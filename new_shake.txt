SCENE.--Verona; Mantua.                            THE PROLOGUE                          Enter Chorus.     Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;     Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.     The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,     And the continuance of their parents' rage,     Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;     The which if you with patient ears attend,     What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.                                                          [Exit.]     ACT I. Scene I. Verona. A public place.  Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet.     Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.    Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.    Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.    Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.    Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.    Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.    Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.    Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.     Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.    Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take     the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.    Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the     wall.    Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,     are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men     from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.    Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.    Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have     fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off     their heads.    Greg. The heads of the maids?    Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.     Take it in what sense thou wilt.    Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.    Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I     am a pretty piece of flesh.    Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst     been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of     Montagues.             Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].     Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.    Greg. How? turn thy back and run?    Samp. Fear me not.    Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!    Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.    Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.    Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is     disgrace to them, if they bear it.    Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?    Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.    Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?    Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?    Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.    Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my     thumb, sir.    Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?    Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.    Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as     you.    Abr. No better.    Samp. Well, sir.                          Enter Benvolio.     Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my     master's kinsmen.    Samp. Yes, better, sir.    Abr. You lie.    Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.                                                      They fight.    Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]     Put up your swords. You know not what you do.                            Enter Tybalt.     Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?     Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.    Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,     Or manage it to part these men with me.    Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word     As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.     Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.       Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or                           partisans.     Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!    Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!             Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.     Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!    Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?    Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come     And flourishes his blade in spite of me.                   Enter Old Montague and his Wife.     Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.    M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.                  Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.     Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,     Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-     Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,     That quench the fire of your pernicious rage     With purple fountains issuing from your veins!     On pain of torture, from those bloody hands     Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground     And hear the sentence of your moved prince.     Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word     By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,     Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets     And made Verona's ancient citizens     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,     Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.     If ever you disturb our streets again,     Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.     For this time all the rest depart away.     You, Capulet, shall go along with me;     And, Montague, come you this afternoon,     To know our farther pleasure in this case,     To old Freetown, our common judgment place.     Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.               Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].    Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?     Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?    Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary     And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.     I drew to part them. In the instant came     The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;     Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,     He swung about his head and cut the winds,     Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.     While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,     Came more and more, and fought on part and part,     Till the Prince came, who parted either part.    M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?     Right glad I am he was not at this fray.    Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun     Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,     A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;     Where, underneath the grove of sycamore     That westward rooteth from the city's side,     So early walking did I see your son.     Towards him I made; but he was ware of me     And stole into the covert of the wood.     I- measuring his affections by my own,     Which then most sought where most might not be found,     Being one too many by my weary self-     Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,     And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.    Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,     With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,     Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;     But all so soon as the all-cheering sun     Should in the furthest East bean to draw     The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,     Away from light steals home my heavy son     And private in his chamber pens himself,     Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight     And makes himself an artificial night.     Black and portentous must this humour prove     Unless good counsel may the cause remove.    Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?    Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him    Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?    Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;     But he, his own affections' counsellor,     Is to himself- I will not say how true-     But to himself so secret and so close,     So far from sounding and discovery,     As is the bud bit with an envious worm     Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air     Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.     Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,     We would as willingly give cure as know.                         Enter Romeo.     Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,     I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.    Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay     To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,                                      Exeunt [Montague and Wife].    Ben. Good morrow, cousin.    Rom. Is the day so young?    Ben. But new struck nine.    Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.     Was that my father that went hence so fast?    Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?    Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.    Ben. In love?    Rom. Out-    Ben. Of love?    Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.    Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,     Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!    Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,     Should without eyes see pathways to his will!     Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?     Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.     Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.     Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!     O anything, of nothing first create!     O heavy lightness! serious vanity!     Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!     Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!     Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is     This love feel I, that feel no love in this.     Dost thou not laugh?    Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.    Rom. Good heart, at what?    Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.    Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.     Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,     Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest     With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown     Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.     Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;     Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;     Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.     What is it else? A madness most discreet,     A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.     Farewell, my coz.    Ben. Soft! I will go along.     An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.    Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:     This is not Romeo, he's some other where.    Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?    Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?    Ben. Groan? Why, no;     But sadly tell me who.    Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.     Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!     In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.    Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.    Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.    Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.    Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit     With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,     And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,     From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.     She will not stay the siege of loving terms,     Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,     Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.     O, she's rich in beauty; only poor     That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.    Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?    Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;     For beauty, starv'd with her severity,     Cuts beauty off from all posterity.     She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,     To merit bliss by making me despair.     She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow     Do I live dead that live to tell it now.    Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.    Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!    Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.     Examine other beauties.    Rom. 'Tis the way     To call hers (exquisite) in question more.     These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,     Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.     He that is strucken blind cannot forget     The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.     Show me a mistress that is passing fair,     What doth her beauty serve but as a note     Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?     Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.    Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.     Scene II. A Street.  Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.     Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,     In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,     For men so old as we to keep the peace.    Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,     And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.     But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?    Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:     My child is yet a stranger in the world,     She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;     Let two more summers wither in their pride     Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.    Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.    Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.     The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;     She is the hopeful lady of my earth.     But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;     My will to her consent is but a part.     An she agree, within her scope of choice     Lies my consent and fair according voice.     This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,     Whereto I have invited many a guest,     Such as I love; and you among the store,     One more, most welcome, makes my number more.     At my poor house look to behold this night     Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.     Such comfort as do lusty young men feel     When well apparell'd April on the heel     Of limping Winter treads, even such delight     Among fresh female buds shall you this night     Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,     And like her most whose merit most shall be;     Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,     May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.     Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,     sirrah, trudge about     Through fair Verona; find those persons out     Whose names are written there, and to them say,     My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-                                      Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].    Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written     that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor     with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter     with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are     here writ, and can never find what names the writing person     hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!                     Enter Benvolio and Romeo.     Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;     One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;     Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;     One desperate grief cures with another's languish.     Take thou some new infection to thy eye,     And the rank poison of the old will die.    Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.    Ben. For what, I pray thee?    Rom. For your broken shin.    Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?    Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;     Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,     Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.    Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?    Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.    Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can     you read anything you see?    Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.    Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!    Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.        'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;       County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;       The lady widow of Vitruvio;       Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;       Mercutio and his brother Valentine;       Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;       My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;       Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;       Lucio and the lively Helena.'      [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they     come?    Serv. Up.    Rom. Whither?    Serv. To supper, to our house.    Rom. Whose house?    Serv. My master's.    Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.    Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great     rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray     come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.    Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's     Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;     With all the admired beauties of Verona.     Go thither, and with unattainted eye     Compare her face with some that I shall show,     And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.    Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye     Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;     And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,     Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!     One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun     Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.    Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,     Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;     But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd     Your lady's love against some other maid     That I will show you shining at this feast,     And she shall scant show well that now seems best.    Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,     But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]     Scene III. Capulet's house.  Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.     Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.    Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,     I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!     God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!                           Enter Juliet.     Jul. How now? Who calls?    Nurse. Your mother.    Jul. Madam, I am here.     What is your will?    Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,     We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;     I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.     Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.    Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.    Wife. She's not fourteen.    Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-     And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-     She is not fourteen. How long is it now     To Lammastide?    Wife. A fortnight and odd days.    Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,     Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.     Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)     Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;     She was too good for me. But, as I said,     On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;     That shall she, marry; I remember it well.     'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;     And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),     Of all the days of the year, upon that day;     For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,     Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.     My lord and you were then at Mantua.     Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,     When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple     Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,     To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!     Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,     To bid me trudge.     And since that time it is eleven years,     For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,     She could have run and waddled all about;     For even the day before, she broke her brow;     And then my husband (God be with his soul!     'A was a merry man) took up the child.     'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?     Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;     Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,     The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'     To see now how a jest shall come about!     I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,     I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,     And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'    Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.    Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh     To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'     And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow     A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;     A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.     'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?     Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;     Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'    Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.    Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!     Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.     An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.    Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme     I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,     How stands your disposition to be married?    Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.    Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,     I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.    Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,     Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,     Are made already mothers. By my count,     I was your mother much upon these years     That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:     The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.    Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man     As all the world- why he's a man of wax.    Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.    Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.    Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?     This night you shall behold him at our feast.     Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,     And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;     Examine every married lineament,     And see how one another lends content;     And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies     Find written in the margent of his eyes,     This precious book of love, this unbound lover,     To beautify him only lacks a cover.     The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride     For fair without the fair within to hide.     That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,     That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;     So shall you share all that he doth possess,     By having him making yourself no less.    Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men    Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?    Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;     But no more deep will I endart mine eye     Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.                          Enter Servingman.     Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,     my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and     everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you     follow straight.    Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].     Juliet, the County stays.    Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene IV. A street.  Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torchbearers.     Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?     Or shall we on without apology?    Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.     We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,     Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,     Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;     Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke     After the prompter, for our entrance;     But, let them measure us by what they will,     We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.    Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.     Being but heavy, I will bear the light.    Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.    Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes     With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead     So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.    Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings     And soar with them above a common bound.    Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft     To soar with his light feathers; and so bound     I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.     Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.    Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-     Too great oppression for a tender thing.    Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,     Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.    Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.     Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.     Give me a case to put my visage in.     A visor for a visor! What care I     What curious eye doth quote deformities?     Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.    Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in     But every man betake him to his legs.    Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart     Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;     For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,     I'll be a candle-holder and look on;     The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.    Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!     If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire     Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st     Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!    Rom. Nay, that's not so.    Mer. I mean, sir, in delay     We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.     Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits     Five times in that ere once in our five wits.    Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;     But 'tis no wit to go.    Mer. Why, may one ask?    Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.    Mer. And so did I.    Rom. Well, what was yours?    Mer. That dreamers often lie.    Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.    Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.     She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes     In shape no bigger than an agate stone     On the forefinger of an alderman,     Drawn with a team of little atomies     Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;     Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,     The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;     Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;     Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;     Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;     Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,     Not half so big as a round little worm     Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;     Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,     Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,     Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.     And in this state she 'gallops night by night     Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;     O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;     O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;     O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,     Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,     Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.     Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,     And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;     And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail     Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,     Then dreams he of another benefice.     Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,     And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,     Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,     Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon     Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,     And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two     And sleeps again. This is that very Mab     That plats the manes of horses in the night     And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,     Which once untangled much misfortune bodes     This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,     That presses them and learns them first to bear,     Making them women of good carriage.     This is she-    Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!     Thou talk'st of nothing.    Mer. True, I talk of dreams;     Which are the children of an idle brain,     Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;     Which is as thin of substance as the air,     And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes     Even now the frozen bosom of the North     And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,     Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.    Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.     Supper is done, and we shall come too late.    Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives     Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,     Shall bitterly begin his fearful date     With this night's revels and expire the term     Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,     By some vile forfeit of untimely death.     But he that hath the steerage of my course     Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!    Ben. Strike, drum.                            They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]     Scene V. Capulet's house.  Servingmen come forth with napkins.    1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?     He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!   2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's     hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.   1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,     look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as     thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.     Anthony, and Potpan!   2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.   1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and     sought for, in the great chamber.   3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!     Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.      Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,               Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests                and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.     Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes     Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.     Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all     Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,     She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?     Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day     That I have worn a visor and could tell     A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,     Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!     You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.     A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.                                     Music plays, and they dance.     More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,     And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.     Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.     Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,     For you and I are past our dancing days.     How long is't now since last yourself and I     Were in a mask?   2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.    Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!     'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,     Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,     Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.   2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;     His son is thirty.    Cap. Will you tell me that?     His son was but a ward two years ago.    Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the     hand Of yonder knight?    Serv. I know not, sir.    Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!     It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night     Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-     Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!     So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows     As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.     The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand     And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.     Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!     For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.    Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.     Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave     Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,     To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?     Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,     To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.    Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?    Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;     A villain, that is hither come in spite     To scorn at our solemnity this night.    Cap. Young Romeo is it?    Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.    Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.     'A bears him like a portly gentleman,     And, to say truth, Verona brags of him     To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.     I would not for the wealth of all this town     Here in my house do him disparagement.     Therefore be patient, take no note of him.     It is my will; the which if thou respect,     Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,     An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.    Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.     I'll not endure him.    Cap. He shall be endur'd.     What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!     Am I the master here, or you? Go to!     You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!     You'll make a mutiny among my guests!     You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!    Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.    Cap. Go to, go to!     You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?     This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.     You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-     Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!     Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!     I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!    Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting     Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.     I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,     Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.    Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand     This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:     My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand     To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.    Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,     Which mannerly devotion shows in this;     For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,     And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.    Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?    Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.    Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!     They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.    Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.    Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.     Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]    Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.    Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!     Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]    Jul. You kiss by th' book.    Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.    Rom. What is her mother?    Nurse. Marry, bachelor,     Her mother is the lady of the house.     And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.     I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.     I tell you, he that can lay hold of her     Shall have the chinks.    Rom. Is she a Capulet?     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.    Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.    Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.    Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;     We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.     Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.     I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.     More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.     Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;     I'll to my rest.                               Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].    Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?    Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.    Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?    Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.    Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?    Nurse. I know not.    Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,     My grave is like to be my wedding bed.    Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,     The only son of your great enemy.    Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!     Too early seen unknown, and known too late!     Prodigious birth of love it is to me     That I must love a loathed enemy.    Nurse. What's this? what's this?    Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now     Of one I danc'd withal.                                      One calls within, 'Juliet.'    Nurse. Anon, anon!     Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.     PROLOGUE  Enter Chorus.     Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,     And young affection gapes to be his heir;     That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,     With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.     Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,     Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;     But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,     And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.     Being held a foe, he may not have access     To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,     And she as much in love, her means much less     To meet her new beloved anywhere;     But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,     Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet. Exit.     ACT II. Scene I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.  Enter Romeo alone.     Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?     Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.                      [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]                     Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.     Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!    Mer. He is wise,     And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.    Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.     Call, good Mercutio.    Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.     Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!     Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;     Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!     Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';     Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,     One nickname for her purblind son and heir,     Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim     When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!     He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;     The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.     I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.     By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,     By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,     And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,     That in thy likeness thou appear to us!    Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.    Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him     To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle     Of some strange nature, letting it there stand     Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.     That were some spite; my invocation     Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,     I conjure only but to raise up him.    Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees     To be consorted with the humorous night.     Blind is his love and best befits the dark.    Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.     Now will he sit under a medlar tree     And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit     As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.     O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were     An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!     Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;     This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.     Come, shall we go?    Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain     'To seek him here that means not to be found.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene II. Capulet's orchard.  Enter Romeo.     Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.                       Enter Juliet above at a window.      But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?     It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,     Who is already sick and pale with grief     That thou her maid art far more fair than she.     Be not her maid, since she is envious.     Her vestal livery is but sick and green,     And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.     It is my lady; O, it is my love!     O that she knew she were!     She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.     I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,     Having some business, do entreat her eyes     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven     Would through the airy region stream so bright     That birds would sing and think it were not night.     See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!     O that I were a glove upon that hand,     That I might touch that cheek!    Jul. Ay me!    Rom. She speaks.     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,     As is a winged messenger of heaven     Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds     And sails upon the bosom of the air.    Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?     Deny thy father and refuse thy name!     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.    Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?    Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!     What's in a name? That which we call a rose     By any other name would smell as sweet.     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,     Retain that dear perfection which he owes     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;     And for that name, which is no part of thee,     Take all myself.    Rom. I take thee at thy word.     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.    Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,     So stumblest on my counsel?    Rom. By a name     I know not how to tell thee who I am.     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,     Because it is an enemy to thee.     Had I it written, I would tear the word.    Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.     Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?    Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.    Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,     And the place death, considering who thou art,     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.    Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;     For stony limits cannot hold love out,     And what love can do, that dares love attempt.     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.    Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.    Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye     Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,     And I am proof against their enmity.    Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.    Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;     And but thou love me, let them find me here.     My life were better ended by their hate     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.    Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?    Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.     He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,     I would adventure for such merchandise.    Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.     Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny     What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!     Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';     And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,     Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,     They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.     Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,     I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,     And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.     I should have been more strange, I must confess,     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,     My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,     And not impute this yielding to light love,     Which the dark night hath so discovered.    Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-    Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,     That monthly changes in her circled orb,     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.    Rom. What shall I swear by?    Jul. Do not swear at all;     Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,     Which is the god of my idolatry,     And I'll believe thee.    Rom. If my heart's dear love-    Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,     I have no joy of this contract to-night.     It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,     May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.     Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!    Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?    Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?    Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.    Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;     And yet I would it were to give again.    Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?    Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.     And yet I wish but for the thing I have.     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,     The more I have, for both are infinite.     I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!                                            [Nurse] calls within.     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.     Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]    Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,     Being in night, all this is but a dream,     Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.                         Enter Juliet above.     Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.     If that thy bent of love be honourable,     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.    Nurse. (within) Madam!    Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,     I do beseech thee-    Nurse. (within) Madam!    Jul. By-and-by I come.-     To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.     To-morrow will I send.    Rom. So thrive my soul-    Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.    Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!     Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;     But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.                       Enter Juliet again, [above].     Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!     Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine     With repetition of my Romeo's name.     Romeo!    Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,     Like softest music to attending ears!    Jul. Romeo!    Rom. My dear?    Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow     Shall I send to thee?    Rom. By the hour of nine.    Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.     I have forgot why I did call thee back.    Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.    Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,     Rememb'ring how I love thy company.    Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,     Forgetting any other home but this.    Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-     And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,     That lets it hop a little from her hand,     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,     So loving-jealous of his liberty.    Rom. I would I were thy bird.    Jul. Sweet, so would I.     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.     Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.                                                          [Exit.]    Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,     His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.  Exit     Scene III. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.     Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,     Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.     Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.     What is her burying gave, that is her womb;     And from her womb children of divers kind     We sucking on her natural bosom find;     Many for many virtues excellent,     None but for some, and yet all different.     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies     In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;     For naught so vile that on the earth doth live     But to the earth some special good doth give;     Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,     And vice sometime's by action dignified.     Within the infant rind of this small flower     Poison hath residence, and medicine power;     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.     Two such opposed kings encamp them still     In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;     And where the worser is predominant,     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.                          Enter Romeo.     Rom. Good morrow, father.    Friar. Benedicite!     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?     Young son, it argues a distempered head     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,     And where care lodges sleep will never lie;     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure     Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;     Or if not so, then here I hit it right-     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.    Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.    Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?    Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.    Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?    Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.     I have been feasting with mine enemy,     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me     That's by me wounded. Both our remedies     Within thy help and holy physic lies.     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,     My intercession likewise steads my foe.    Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.    Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,     And all combin'd, save what thou must combine     By holy marriage. When, and where, and how     We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,     That thou consent to marry us to-day.    Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!     Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,     So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.     Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!     How much salt water thrown away in waste,     To season love, that of it doth not taste!     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,     Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.     If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.     And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:     Women may fall when there's no strength in men.    Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.    Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.    Rom. And bad'st me bury love.    Friar. Not in a grave     To lay one in, another out to have.    Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.     The other did not so.    Friar. O, she knew well     Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.     But come, young waverer, come go with me.     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;     For this alliance may so happy prove     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.    Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.    Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene IV. A street.  Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.     Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?     Came he not home to-night?    Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.    Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,     Torments him so that he will sure run mad.    Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.    Mer. A challenge, on my life.    Ben. Romeo will answer it.    Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.    Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,     being dared.    Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white     wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the     very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's     butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?    Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?    Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the     courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing     pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his     minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very     butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman     of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the     immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.    Ben. The what?    Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-     these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very     tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,     grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange     flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand     so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old     bench? O, their bones, their bones!                                 Enter Romeo.     Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!    Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how     art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch     flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she     had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,     but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French     salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit     fairly last night.    Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?    Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?    Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a     case as mine a man may strain courtesy.    Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a     man to bow in the hams.    Rom. Meaning, to cursy.    Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.    Rom. A most courteous exposition.    Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.    Rom. Pink for flower.    Mer. Right.    Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.    Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out     thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may     remain, after the wearing, solely singular.    Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!    Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.    Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.    Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for     thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am     sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?    Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not     there for the goose.    Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.    Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!    Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.    Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?    Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch     narrow to an ell broad!    Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to     the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.    Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now     art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by     art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a     great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in     a hole.    Ben. Stop there, stop there!    Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.    Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.    Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I     was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to     occupy the argument no longer.    Rom. Here's goodly gear!                        Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].     Mer. A sail, a sail!    Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.    Nurse. Peter!    Peter. Anon.    Nurse. My fan, Peter.    Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of     the two.    Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.    Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.    Nurse. Is it good-den?    Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is     now upon the prick of noon.    Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!    Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.    Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'     quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the     young Romeo?    Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you     have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest     of that name, for fault of a worse.    Nurse. You say well.    Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,     wisely.    Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.    Ben. She will endite him to some supper.    Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!    Rom. What hast thou found?    Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is     something stale and hoar ere it be spent                                      He walks by them and sings.                     An old hare hoar,                    And an old hare hoar,                 Is very good meat in Lent;                    But a hare that is hoar                    Is too much for a score                 When it hoars ere it be spent.      Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.    Rom. I will follow you.    Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,     [sings] lady, lady, lady.                                       Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.    Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant     was this that was so full of his ropery?    Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and     will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.    Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an 'a     were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,     I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his     flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must     stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!    Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my     weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as     soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the     law on my side.    Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me     quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,     my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I     will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead     her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of     behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and     therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were     an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.    Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto     thee-    Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,     Lord! she will be a joyful woman.    Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.    Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I     take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.    Rom. Bid her devise     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell     Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.    Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.    Rom. Go to! I say you shall.    Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.    Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.     Within this hour my man shall be with thee     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,     Which to the high topgallant of my joy     Must be my convoy in the secret night.     Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.     Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.    Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.    Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?    Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?    Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.    Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!     when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in     town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,     good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I     anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;     but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any     clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both     with a letter?    Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.    Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I     know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest     sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you     good to hear it.    Rom. Commend me to thy lady.    Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!    Peter. Anon.    Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene V. Capulet's orchard.  Enter Juliet.     Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;     In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.     Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.     O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams     Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve     Is three long hours; yet she is not come.     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,     And his to me,     But old folks, many feign as they were dead-     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.                        Enter Nurse [and Peter].      O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.    Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.                                                    [Exit Peter.]    Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news     By playing it to me with so sour a face.    Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.     Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!    Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.     Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.    Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?     Do you not see that I am out of breath?    Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath     To say to me that thou art out of breath?     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.     Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?    Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to     choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better     than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a     foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet     they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll     warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve God.     What, have you din'd at home?    Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.     What says he of our marriage? What of that?    Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.     My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!     Beshrew your heart for sending me about     To catch my death with jauncing up and down!    Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.     Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?    Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,     and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where     is your mother?    Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,     "Where is your mother?"'    Nurse. O God's Lady dear!     Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?     Henceforward do your messages yourself.    Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?    Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?    Jul. I have.    Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;     There stays a husband to make you a wife.     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.     Hie you to church; I must another way,     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.     I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;     But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.     Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.    Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene VI. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.     Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act     That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!    Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy     That one short minute gives me in her sight.     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,     Then love-devouring death do what he dare-     It is enough I may but call her mine.    Friar. These violent delights have violent ends     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,     Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey     Is loathsome in his own deliciousness     And in the taste confounds the appetite.     Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.                       Enter Juliet.      Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.     A lover may bestride the gossamer     That idles in the wanton summer air,     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.    Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.    Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.    Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.    Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy     Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue     Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both     Receive in either by this dear encounter.    Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,     Brags of his substance, not of ornament.     They are but beggars that can count their worth;     But my true love is grown to such excess     cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.    Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone     Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.                                                        [Exeunt.]     ACT III. Scene I. A public place.  Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.     Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.     And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.    Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters     the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and     says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the     second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.    Ben. Am I like such a fellow?    Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in     Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be     moved.    Ben. And what to?    Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,     for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a     man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.     Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an     eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels     as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as     addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a     man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog     that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a     tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with     another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt     tutor me from quarrelling!    Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should     buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.    Mer. The fee simple? O simple!                         Enter Tybalt and others.     Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.    Mer. By my heel, I care not.    Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.     Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.    Mer. And but one word with one of us?     Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.    Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me     occasion.    Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving    Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.    Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make     minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my     fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!    Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.     Either withdraw unto some private place     And reason coldly of your grievances,     Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.    Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.     I will not budge for no man's pleasure,                          Enter Romeo.     Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.    Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!     Your worship in that sense may call him man.    Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford     No better term than this: thou art a villain.    Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage     To such a greeting. Villain am I none.     Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.    Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.    Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,     But love thee better than thou canst devise     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;     And so good Capulet, which name I tender     As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.    Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!     Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]     Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?    Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?    Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives. That I     mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,      dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out     of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your     ears ere it be out.    Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]    Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.    Mer. Come, sir, your passado!                                                    [They fight.]    Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.     Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!     Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath     Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.     Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!          Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies                                            [with his Followers].    Mer. I am hurt.     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.     Is he gone and hath nothing?    Ben. What, art thou hurt?    Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.                                                     [Exit Page.]    Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.    Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;     but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you     shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this     world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a     mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue, a     villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil     came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.    Rom. I thought all for the best.    Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!     They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,     And soundly too. Your houses!                                  [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].    Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,     My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt     In my behalf- my reputation stain'd     With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour     Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate     And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel                        Enter Benvolio.     Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!     That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.    Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;     This but begins the woe others must end.                         Enter Tybalt.     Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.    Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?     Away to heaven respective lenity,     And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!     Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul     Is but a little way above our heads,     Staying for thine to keep him company.     Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.    Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,     Shalt with him hence.    Rom. This shall determine that.                                        They fight. Tybalt falls.    Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.     Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death     If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!    Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!    Ben. Why dost thou stay?                                                      Exit Romeo.                       Enter Citizens.     Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?     Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?    Ben. There lies that Tybalt.    Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.     I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.     Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,                      and [others].     Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?    Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.    Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!     O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd     Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,     For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.     O cousin, cousin!    Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?    Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.     Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink     How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal     Your high displeasure. All this- uttered     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;     Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats     Cold death aside and with the other sends     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity     Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,     'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;     But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,     And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.    Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;     Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,     And all those twenty could but kill one life.     I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.     Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.    Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?    Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;     His fault concludes but what the law should end,     The life of Tybalt.    Prince. And for that offence     Immediately we do exile him hence.     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine     That you shall all repent the loss of mine.     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.     Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,     Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.     Bear hence this body, and attend our will.     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene II. Capulet's orchard.  Enter Juliet alone.     Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,     Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner     As Phaeton would whip you to the West     And bring in cloudy night immediately.     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,     That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo     Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,     And learn me how to lose a winning match,     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,     With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,     Think true love acted simple modesty.     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night     Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.     Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,     Take him and cut him out in little stars,     And he will make the face of heaven so fine     That all the world will be in love with night     And pay no worship to the garish sun.     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,     But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,     Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day     As is the night before some festival     To an impatient child that hath new robes     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,                  Enter Nurse, with cords.      And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords     That Romeo bid thee fetch?    Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.                                              [Throws them down.]    Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands    Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!     We are undone, lady, we are undone!     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!    Jul. Can heaven be so envious?    Nurse. Romeo can,     Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!    Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.     Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.     I am not I, if there be such an 'I';     Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'     If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.    Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,     (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,     All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.    Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!     To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!    Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman     That ever I should live to see thee dead!    Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?     Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?     My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!     For who is living, if those two are gone?    Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.    Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?    Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!    Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!     Despised substance of divinest show!     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-     A damned saint, an honourable villain!     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend     In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?     Was ever book containing such vile matter     So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell     In such a gorgeous palace!    Nurse. There's no trust,     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.     Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.     Shame come to Romeo!    Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue     For such a wish! He was not born to shame.     Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd     Sole monarch of the universal earth.     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!    Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?    Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?     But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!     Your tributary drops belong to woe,     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,     That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;     But O, it presses to my memory     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death     Was woe enough, if it had ended there;     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,     Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,     Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?     But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,     'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.     Where is my father and my mother, nurse?    Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.    Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.     Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,     Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.     He made you for a highway to my bed;     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.     Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!    Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo     To comfort you. I wot well where he is.     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.    Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight     And bid him come to take his last farewell.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene III. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar [Laurence].     Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.     Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,     And thou art wedded to calamity.                           Enter Romeo.     Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand     That I yet know not?    Friar. Too familiar     Is my dear son with such sour company.     I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.    Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?    Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-     Not body's death, but body's banishment.    Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';     For exile hath more terror in his look,     Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'    Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.    Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.     Hence banished is banish'd from the world,     And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'     Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'     Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.    Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!     Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,     Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,     And turn'd that black word death to banishment.     This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.    Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,     Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog     And little mouse, every unworthy thing,     Live here in heaven and may look on her;     But Romeo may not. More validity,     More honourable state, more courtship lives     In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize     On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand     And steal immortal blessing from her lips,     Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,     Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;     But Romeo may not- he is banished.     This may flies do, when I from this must fly;     They are free men, but I am banished.     And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?     Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,     No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,     But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?     O friar, the damned use that word in hell;     Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,     Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,     A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,     To mangle me with that word 'banished'?    Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.    Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.    Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;     Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,     To comfort thee, though thou art banished.    Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!     Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,     Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,     It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.    Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.    Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?    Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.    Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.     Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,     An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,     Doting like me, and like me banished,     Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,     And fall upon the ground, as I do now,     Taking the measure of an unmade grave.                                                  Knock [within].    Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.    Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,     Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.    Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;     Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.     Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,     What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.     Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will    Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.     I come from Lady Juliet.    Friar. Welcome then.                         Enter Nurse.     Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar     Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?    Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.    Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,     Just in her case!    Friar. O woeful sympathy!     Piteous predicament!    Nurse. Even so lies she,     Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.     Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.     For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!     Why should you fall into so deep an O?    Rom. (rises) Nurse-    Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.    Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?     Doth not she think me an old murtherer,     Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy     With blood remov'd but little from her own?     Where is she? and how doth she! and what says     My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?    Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;     And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,     And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,     And then down falls again.    Rom. As if that name,     Shot from the deadly level of a gun,     Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand     Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,     In what vile part of this anatomy     Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack     The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]    Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.     Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;     Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote     The unreasonable fury of a beast.     Unseemly woman in a seeming man!     Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!     Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,     I thought thy disposition better temper'd.     Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?     And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,     By doing damned hate upon thyself?     Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?     Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet     In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.     Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,     Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,     And usest none in that true use indeed     Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.     Thy noble shape is but a form of wax     Digressing from the valour of a man;     Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,     Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;     Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,     Misshapen in the conduct of them both,     Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,     is get afire by thine own ignorance,     And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.     What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,     For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.     There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,     But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.     The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend     And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.     A pack of blessings light upon thy back;     Happiness courts thee in her best array;     But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,     Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.     Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.     Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,     Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.     But look thou stay not till the watch be set,     For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,     Where thou shalt live till we can find a time     To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,     Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back     With twenty hundred thousand times more joy     Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.     Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,     And bid her hasten all the house to bed,     Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.     Romeo is coming.    Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night     To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!     My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.    Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.    Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.     Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.    Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!    Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:     Either be gone before the watch be set,     Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.     Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,     And he shall signify from time to time     Every good hap to you that chances here.     Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.    Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,     It were a grief so brief to part with thee.     Farewell.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene IV. Capulet's house  Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.     Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily     That we have had no time to move our daughter.     Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,     And so did I. Well, we were born to die.     'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.     I promise you, but for your company,     I would have been abed an hour ago.    Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.     Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.    Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;     To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.    Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender     Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd     In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.     Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;     Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love     And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-     But, soft! what day is this?    Par. Monday, my lord.    Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.     Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her     She shall be married to this noble earl.     Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?     We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;     For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,     It may be thought we held him carelessly,     Being our kinsman, if we revel much.     Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,     And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?    Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.    Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.     Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;     Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.     Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!     Afore me, It is so very very late     That we may call it early by-and-by.     Good night.                                                           Exeunt     Scene V. Capulet's orchard.  Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.     Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.     It was the nightingale, and not the lark,     That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.     Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.     Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.    Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;     No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks     Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.     Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day     Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.     I must be gone and live, or stay and die.    Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.     It is some meteor that the sun exhales     To be to thee this night a torchbearer     And light thee on the way to Mantua.     Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.    Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.     I am content, so thou wilt have it so.     I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,     'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;     Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat     The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.     I have more care to stay than will to go.     Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.     How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.    Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!     It is the lark that sings so out of tune,     Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.     Some say the lark makes sweet division;     This doth not so, for she divideth us.     Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;     O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,     Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,     Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!     O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.    Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!                            Enter Nurse.     Nurse. Madam!    Jul. Nurse?    Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.     The day is broke; be wary, look about.    Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.                                                          [Exit.]    Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.                                                   He goeth down.    Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?     I must hear from thee every day in the hour,     For in a minute there are many days.     O, by this count I shall be much in years     Ere I again behold my Romeo!    Rom. Farewell!     I will omit no opportunity     That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.    Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?    Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve     For sweet discourses in our time to come.    Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!     Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,     As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.     Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.    Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.     Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu! Exit.    Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.     If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him     That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,     For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long     But send him back.    Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?    Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.     Is she not down so late, or up so early?     What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?                         Enter Mother.     Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?    Jul. Madam, I am not well.    Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?     What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?     An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.     Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;     But much of grief shows still some want of wit.    Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.    Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend     Which you weep for.    Jul. Feeling so the loss,     I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.    Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death     As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.    Jul. What villain, madam?    Lady. That same villain Romeo.    Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-     God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;     And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.    Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.    Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.     Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!    Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.     Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,     Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,     Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram     That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;     And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.    Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied     With Romeo till I behold him- dead-     Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.     Madam, if you could find out but a man     To bear a poison, I would temper it;     That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,     Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors     To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,     To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt     Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!    Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.     But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.    Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.     What are they, I beseech your ladyship?    Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;     One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,     Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy     That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.    Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?    Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn     The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,     The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,     Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.    Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,     He shall not make me there a joyful bride!     I wonder at this haste, that I must wed     Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.     I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,     I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear     It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,     Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!    Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,     And see how he will take it at your hands.                     Enter Capulet and Nurse.     Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,     But for the sunset of my brother's son     It rains downright.     How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?     Evermore show'ring? In one little body     Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:     For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,     Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is     Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,     Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,     Without a sudden calm will overset     Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?     Have you delivered to her our decree?    Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.     I would the fool were married to her grave!    Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.     How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?     Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,     Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought     So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?    Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.     Proud can I never be of what I hate,     But thankful even for hate that is meant love.    Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?     'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-     And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,     Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,     But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next     To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,     Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.     Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!     You tallow-face!    Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?    Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,     Hear me with patience but to speak a word.    Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!     I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday     Or never after look me in the face.     Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!     My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest     That God had lent us but this only child;     But now I see this one is one too much,     And that we have a curse in having her.     Out on her, hilding!    Nurse. God in heaven bless her!     You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.    Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,     Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!    Nurse. I speak no treason.    Cap. O, God-i-god-en!    Nurse. May not one speak?    Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!     Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,     For here we need it not.    Lady. You are too hot.    Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,     At home, abroad, alone, in company,     Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been     To have her match'd; and having now provided     A gentleman of princely parentage,     Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,     Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,     Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-     And then to have a wretched puling fool,     A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,     To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;     I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!     But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.     Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.     Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.     Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:     An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;     An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,     For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,     Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.     Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.    Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds     That sees into the bottom of my grief?     O sweet my mother, cast me not away!     Delay this marriage for a month, a week;     Or if you do not, make the bridal bed     In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.    Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.     Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.    Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?     My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.     How shall that faith return again to earth     Unless that husband send it me from heaven     By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.     Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems     Upon so soft a subject as myself!     What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?     Some comfort, nurse.    Nurse. Faith, here it is.     Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing     That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;     Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.     Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,     I think it best you married with the County.     O, he's a lovely gentleman!     Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,     Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye     As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,     I think you are happy in this second match,     For it excels your first; or if it did not,     Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were     As living here and you no use of him.    Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?    Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.    Jul. Amen!    Nurse. What?    Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.     Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,     Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,     To make confession and to be absolv'd.    Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.    Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!     Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,     Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue     Which she hath prais'd him with above compare     So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!     Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.     I'll to the friar to know his remedy.     If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.     ACT IV. Scene I. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.     Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.    Par. My father Capulet will have it so,     And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.    Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.     Uneven is the course; I like it not.    Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,     And therefore have I little talk'd of love;     For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.     Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous     That she do give her sorrow so much sway,     And in his wisdom hastes our marriage     To stop the inundation of her tears,     Which, too much minded by herself alone,     May be put from her by society.     Now do you know the reason of this haste.    Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-     Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.                      Enter Juliet.     Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!    Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.    Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.    Jul. What must be shall be.    Friar. That's a certain text.    Par. Come you to make confession to this father?    Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.    Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.    Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.    Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.    Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,     Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.    Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.    Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,     For it was bad enough before their spite.    Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.    Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;     And what I spake, I spake it to my face.    Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.    Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.     Are you at leisure, holy father, now,     Or shall I come to you at evening mass    Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.     My lord, we must entreat the time alone.    Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!     Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.     Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.    Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,     Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!    Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;     It strains me past the compass of my wits.     I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,     On Thursday next be married to this County.    Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,     Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.     If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,     Do thou but call my resolution wise     And with this knife I'll help it presently.     God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;     And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,     Shall be the label to another deed,     Or my true heart with treacherous revolt     Turn to another, this shall slay them both.     Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,     Give me some present counsel; or, behold,     'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife     Shall play the empire, arbitrating that     Which the commission of thy years and art     Could to no issue of true honour bring.     Be not so long to speak. I long to die     If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.    Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,     Which craves as desperate an execution     As that is desperate which we would prevent.     If, rather than to marry County Paris     Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,     Then is it likely thou wilt undertake     A thing like death to chide away this shame,     That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;     And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.    Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,     From off the battlements of yonder tower,     Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk     Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,     Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,     O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,     With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;     Or bid me go into a new-made grave     And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-     Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-     And I will do it without fear or doubt,     To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.    Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent     To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.     To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;     Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.     Take thou this vial, being then in bed,     And this distilled liquor drink thou off;     When presently through all thy veins shall run     A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse     Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;     No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;     The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade     To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall     Like death when he shuts up the day of life;     Each part, depriv'd of supple government,     Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;     And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death     Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,     And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.     Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes     To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.     Then, as the manner of our country is,     In thy best robes uncovered on the bier     Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault     Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.     In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,     Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;     And hither shall he come; and he and I     Will watch thy waking, and that very night     Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.     And this shall free thee from this present shame,     If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear     Abate thy valour in the acting it.    Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!    Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous     In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed     To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.    Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.     Farewell, dear father.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene II. Capulet's house.  Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,                         two or three.     Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.                                             [Exit a Servingman.]     Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.    Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can     lick their fingers.    Cap. How canst thou try them so?    Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own     fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not     with me.    Cap. Go, begone.                                                 Exit Servingman.     We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.     What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?    Nurse. Ay, forsooth.    Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.     A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.                          Enter Juliet.     Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.    Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?    Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin     Of disobedient opposition     To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd     By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here     To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!     Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.    Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.     I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.    Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell     And gave him what becomed love I might,     Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.    Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.     This is as't should be. Let me see the County.     Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.     Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,     All our whole city is much bound to him.    Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet     To help me sort such needful ornaments     As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?    Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.    Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.                                         Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.    Mother. We shall be short in our provision.     'Tis now near night.    Cap. Tush, I will stir about,     And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.     Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.     I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.     I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!     They are all forth; well, I will walk myself     To County Paris, to prepare him up     Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,     Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene III. Juliet's chamber.  Enter Juliet and Nurse.     Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,     I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;     For I have need of many orisons     To move the heavens to smile upon my state,     Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.                            Enter Mother.     Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?    Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries     As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.     So please you, let me now be left alone,     And let the nurse this night sit up with you;     For I am sure you have your hands full all     In this so sudden business.    Mother. Good night.     Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.                                       Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]    Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.     I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins     That almost freezes up the heat of life.     I'll call them back again to comfort me.     Nurse!- What should she do here?     My dismal scene I needs must act alone.     Come, vial.     What if this mixture do not work at all?     Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?     No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.                                              Lays down a dagger.     What if it be a poison which the friar     Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,     Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd     Because he married me before to Romeo?     I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,     For he hath still been tried a holy man.     I will not entertain so bad a thought.     How if, when I am laid into the tomb,     I wake before the time that Romeo     Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!     Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,     To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,     And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?     Or, if I live, is it not very like     The horrible conceit of death and night,     Together with the terror of the place-     As in a vault, an ancient receptacle     Where for this many hundred years the bones     Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;     Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,     Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,     At some hours in the night spirits resort-     Alack, alack, is it not like that I,     So early waking- what with loathsome smells,     And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-     O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,     Environed with all these hideous fears,     And madly play with my forefathers' joints,     And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,     And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone     As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?     O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost     Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body     Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!     Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.          She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.     Scene IV. Capulet's house.  Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.     Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.    Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.                         Enter Old Capulet.     Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,     The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.     Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;     Spare not for cost.    Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,     Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow     For this night's watching.    Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now     All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.    Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;     But I will watch you from such watching now.                                           Exeunt Lady and Nurse.    Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!     Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.      What is there? Now, fellow,    Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.    Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier       logs.     Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.    Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs     And never trouble Peter for the matter.    Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!     Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.     The County will be here with music straight,     For so he said he would.                         Play music.     I hear him near.     Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!                                Enter Nurse.     Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.     I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,     Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:     Make haste, I say.                                                        [Exeunt.]     Scene V. Juliet's chamber.  [Enter Nurse.]     Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.     Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!     Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!     What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!     Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,     The County Paris hath set up his rest     That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!     Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!     I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!     Ay, let the County take you in your bed!     He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?                                      [Draws aside the curtains.]     What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?     I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!     Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!     O weraday that ever I was born!     Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!                             Enter Mother.     Mother. What noise is here?    Nurse. O lamentable day!    Mother. What is the matter?    Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!    Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!     Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!     Help, help! Call help.                              Enter Father.     Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.    Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!    Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!    Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,     Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;     Life and these lips have long been separated.     Death lies on her like an untimely frost     Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.    Nurse. O lamentable day!    Mother. O woful time!    Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,     Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.     Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.     Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?    Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.     O son, the night before thy wedding day     Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,     Flower as she was, deflowered by him.     Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;     My daughter he hath wedded. I will die     And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.    Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,     And doth it give me such a sight as this?    Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!     Most miserable hour that e'er time saw     In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!     But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,     But one thing to rejoice and solace in,     And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!    Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!     Most lamentable day, most woful day     That ever ever I did yet behold!     O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!     Never was seen so black a day as this.     O woful day! O woful day!    Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!     Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,     By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!     O love! O life! not life, but love in death    Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!     Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now     To murther, murther our solemnity?     O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!     Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,     And with my child my joys are buried!    Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not     In these confusions. Heaven and yourself     Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,     And all the better is it for the maid.     Your part in her you could not keep from death,     But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.     The most you sought was her promotion,     For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;     And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd     Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?     O, in this love, you love your child so ill     That you run mad, seeing that she is well.     She's not well married that lives married long,     But she's best married that dies married young.     Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary     On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,     In all her best array bear her to church;     For though fond nature bids us all lament,     Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.    Cap. All things that we ordained festival     Turn from their office to black funeral-     Our instruments to melancholy bells,     Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;     Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;     Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;     And all things change them to the contrary.    Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;     And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare     To follow this fair corse unto her grave.     The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;     Move them no more by crossing their high will.                            Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].   1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.    Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!     For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]   1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.                           Enter Peter.     Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!     O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'   1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',    Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is     full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.   1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.    Pet. You will not then?   1. Mus. No.    Pet. I will then give it you soundly.   1. Mus. What will you give us?    Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the      minstrel.   1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.    Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.     I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you     note me?   1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.   2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.    Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an     iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.             'When griping grief the heart doth wound,              And doleful dumps the mind oppress,            Then music with her silver sound'-      Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?     What say you, Simon Catling?   1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.    Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?   2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.    Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?   3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.    Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It     is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no     gold for sounding.             'Then music with her silver sound              With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.    1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?   2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the     mourners, and stay dinner.                                                          Exeunt.     ACT V. Scene I. Mantua. A street.  Enter Romeo.     Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep     My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.     My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,     And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit     Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.     I dreamt my lady came and found me dead     (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)     And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips     That I reviv'd and was an emperor.     Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,     When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!                  Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.      News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?     Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?     How doth my lady? Is my father well?     How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,     For nothing can be ill if she be well.    Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.     Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,     And her immortal part with angels lives.     I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault     And presently took post to tell it you.     O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,     Since you did leave it for my office, sir.    Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!     Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper     And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.    Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.     Your looks are pale and wild and do import     Some misadventure.    Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.     Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.     Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?    Man. No, my good lord.    Rom. No matter. Get thee gone     And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.                                                Exit [Balthasar].     Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.     Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift     To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!     I do remember an apothecary,     And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted     In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,     Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,     Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;     And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,     An alligator stuff'd, and other skins     Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves     A beggarly account of empty boxes,     Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,     Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses     Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.     Noting this penury, to myself I said,     'An if a man did need a poison now     Whose sale is present death in Mantua,     Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'     O, this same thought did but forerun my need,     And this same needy man must sell it me.     As I remember, this should be the house.     Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!                          Enter Apothecary.     Apoth. Who calls so loud?    Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.     Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear     As will disperse itself through all the veins     That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,     And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath     As violently as hasty powder fir'd     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.    Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law     Is death to any he that utters them.    Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness     And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,     Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,     Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:     The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;     The world affords no law to make thee rich;     Then be not poor, but break it and take this.    Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.    Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.    Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will     And drink it off, and if you had the strength     Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.    Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,     Doing more murther in this loathsome world,     Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.     I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.     Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.     Come, cordial and not poison, go with me     To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.                                                          Exeunt.     Scene II. Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.  Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.     John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!                        Enter Friar Laurence.     Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.     Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?     Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.    John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,     One of our order, to associate me     Here in this city visiting the sick,     And finding him, the searchers of the town,     Suspecting that we both were in a house     Where the infectious pestilence did reign,     Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,     So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.    Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?    John. I could not send it- here it is again-     Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,     So fearful were they of infection.    Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,     The letter was not nice, but full of charge,     Of dear import; and the neglecting it     May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,     Get me an iron crow and bring it straight     Unto my cell.    John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.    Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.     Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.     She will beshrew me much that Romeo     Hath had no notice of these accidents;     But I will write again to Mantua,     And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-     Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.     Scene III. Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.  Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].     Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.     Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.     Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread     (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)     But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,     As signal that thou hear'st something approach.     Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.    Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone     Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]    Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew     (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)     Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;     Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.     The obsequies that I for thee will keep     Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.                                                     Whistle Boy.     The boy gives warning something doth approach.     What cursed foot wanders this way to-night     To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?     What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]         Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,                     and a crow of iron.     Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.     Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning     See thou deliver it to my lord and father.     Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,     Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof     And do not interrupt me in my course.     Why I descend into this bed of death     Is partly to behold my lady's face,     But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger     A precious ring- a ring that I must use     In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.     But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry     In what I farther shall intend to do,     By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint     And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.     The time and my intents are savage-wild,     More fierce and more inexorable far     Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.    Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.    Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.     Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.    Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.     His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]    Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,     Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,     Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,     And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.                                            Romeo opens the tomb.    Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague     That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief     It is supposed the fair creature died-     And here is come to do some villanous shame     To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.     Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!     Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?     Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.     Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.    Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.     Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.     Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;     Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,     But not another sin upon my head     By urging me to fury. O, be gone!     By heaven, I love thee better than myself,     For I come hither arm'd against myself.     Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say     A madman's mercy bid thee run away.    Par. I do defy thy, conjuration     And apprehend thee for a felon here.    Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!                                                      They fight.    Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.                                             [Exit. Paris falls.]    Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,     Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]    Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.     Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!     What said my man when my betossed soul     Did not attend him as we rode? I think     He told me Paris should have married Juliet.     Said he not so? or did I dream it so?     Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet     To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,     One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!     I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.     A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,     For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes     This vault a feasting presence full of light.     Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.                                          [Lays him in the tomb.]     How oft when men are at the point of death     Have they been merry! which their keepers call     A lightning before death. O, how may I     Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!     Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,     Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.     Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet     Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,     And death's pale flag is not advanced there.     Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?     O, what more favour can I do to thee     Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain     To sunder his that was thine enemy?     Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,     Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe     That unsubstantial Death is amorous,     And that the lean abhorred monster keeps     Thee here in dark to be his paramour?     For fear of that I still will stay with thee     And never from this palace of dim night     Depart again. Here, here will I remain     With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here     Will I set up my everlasting rest     And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars     From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!     Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you     The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss     A dateless bargain to engrossing death!     Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on     The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!     Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!     Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.      Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.     Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night     Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?    Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.    Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,     What torch is yond that vainly lends his light     To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,     It burneth in the Capels' monument.    Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,     One that you love.    Friar. Who is it?    Bal. Romeo.    Friar. How long hath he been there?    Bal. Full half an hour.    Friar. Go with me to the vault.    Bal. I dare not, sir.     My master knows not but I am gone hence,     And fearfully did menace me with death     If I did stay to look on his intents.    Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.     O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.    Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,     I dreamt my master and another fought,     And that my master slew him.    Friar. Romeo!     Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains     The stony entrance of this sepulchre?     What mean these masterless and gory swords     To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]     Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?     And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour     Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.                                                    Juliet rises.    Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?     I do remember well where I should be,     And there I am. Where is my Romeo?    Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest     Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.     A greater power than we can contradict     Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.     Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;     And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee     Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.     Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.     Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.    Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.                                                    Exit [Friar].     What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?     Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.     O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop     To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.     Haply some poison yet doth hang on them     To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]     Thy lips are warm!    Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?     Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!                                       [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]     This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.                   She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].                  Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.     Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.    Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.     Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.                                      [Exeunt some of the Watch.]     Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;     And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,     Who here hath lain this two days buried.     Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;     Raise up the Montagues; some others search.                                    [Exeunt others of the Watch.]     We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,     But the true ground of all these piteous woes     We cannot without circumstance descry.       Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].    2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.    Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.            Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.    3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.     We took this mattock and this spade from him     As he was coming from this churchyard side.    Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.                Enter the Prince [and Attendants].     Prince. What misadventure is so early up,     That calls our person from our morning rest?              Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].     Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?    Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'     Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,     With open outcry, toward our monument.    Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?    Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;     And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,     Warm and new kill'd.    Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.    Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,     With instruments upon them fit to open     These dead men's tombs.    Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!     This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house     Is empty on the back of Montague,     And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!    Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell     That warns my old age to a sepulchre.                 Enter Montague [and others].     Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up     To see thy son and heir more early down.    Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!     Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.     What further woe conspires against mine age?    Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.    Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,     To press before thy father to a grave?    Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,     Till we can clear these ambiguities     And know their spring, their head, their true descent;     And then will I be general of your woes     And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,     And let mischance be slave to patience.     Bring forth the parties of suspicion.    Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,     Yet most suspected, as the time and place     Doth make against me, of this direful murther;     And here I stand, both to impeach and purge     Myself condemned and myself excus'd.    Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.    Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath     Is not so long as is a tedious tale.     Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;     And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.     I married them; and their stol'n marriage day     Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death     Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;     For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.     You, to remove that siege of grief from her,     Betroth'd and would have married her perforce     To County Paris. Then comes she to me     And with wild looks bid me devise some mean     To rid her from this second marriage,     Or in my cell there would she kill herself.     Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)     A sleeping potion; which so took effect     As I intended, for it wrought on her     The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo     That he should hither come as this dire night     To help to take her from her borrowed grave,     Being the time the potion's force should cease.     But he which bore my letter, Friar John,     Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight     Return'd my letter back. Then all alone     At the prefixed hour of her waking     Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;     Meaning to keep her closely at my cell     Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.     But when I came, some minute ere the time     Of her awaking, here untimely lay     The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.     She wakes; and I entreated her come forth     And bear this work of heaven with patience;     But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,     And she, too desperate, would not go with me,     But, as it seems, did violence on herself.     All this I know, and to the marriage     Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this     Miscarried by my fault, let my old life     Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,     Unto the rigour of severest law.    Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.     Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?    Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;     And then in post he came from Mantua     To this same place, to this same monument.     This letter he early bid me give his father,     And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,     If I departed not and left him there.    Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.     Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?     Sirrah, what made your master in this place?    Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;     And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.     Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;     And by-and-by my master drew on him;     And then I ran away to call the watch.    Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,     Their course of love, the tidings of her death;     And here he writes that he did buy a poison     Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal     Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.     Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,     See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,     That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!     And I, for winking at you, discords too,     Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.    Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.     This is my daughter's jointure, for no more     Can I demand.    Mon. But I can give thee more;     For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,     That whiles Verona by that name is known,     There shall no figure at such rate be set     As that of true and faithful Juliet.    Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-     Poor sacrifices of our enmity!    Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.     The sun for sorrow will not show his head.     Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;     Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;     For never was a story of more woe     Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.                                                    Exeunt omnes.  THE END  Othello, the Moore of Venice ACT I SCENE I. Venice. A street. Enter RODERIGO and IAGO RODERIGO Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. IAGO 'Sblood, but you will not hear me: If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me. RODERIGO Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. IAGO Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, I know my price, I am worth no worse a place: But he; as loving his own pride and purposes, Evades them, with a bombast circumstance Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war; And, in conclusion, Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he, 'I have already chose my officer.' And what was he? Forsooth, a great arithmetician, One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife; That never set a squadron in the field, Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise, Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election: And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster, He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient. RODERIGO By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. IAGO Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service, Preferment goes by letter and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself, Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor. RODERIGO I would not follow him then. IAGO O, sir, content you; I follow him to serve my turn upon him: We cannot all be masters, nor all masters Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd: Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul; And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: In following him, I follow but myself; Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, But seeming so, for my peculiar end: For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In compliment extern, 'tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. RODERIGO What a full fortune does the thicklips owe If he can carry't thus! IAGO Call up her father, Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight, Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, As it may lose some colour. RODERIGO Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud. IAGO Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell As when, by night and negligence, the fire Is spied in populous cities. RODERIGO What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! IAGO Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves! Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! Thieves! thieves! BRABANTIO appears above, at a window  BRABANTIO What is the reason of this terrible summons? What is the matter there? RODERIGO Signior, is all your family within? IAGO Are your doors lock'd? BRABANTIO Why, wherefore ask you this? IAGO 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown; Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; Even now, now, very now, an old black ram Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise; Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you: Arise, I say. BRABANTIO What, have you lost your wits? RODERIGO Most reverend signior, do you know my voice? BRABANTIO Not I what are you? RODERIGO My name is Roderigo. BRABANTIO The worser welcome: I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors: In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness, Being full of supper and distempering draughts, Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come To start my quiet. RODERIGO Sir, sir, sir,-- BRABANTIO But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee. RODERIGO Patience, good sir. BRABANTIO What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice; My house is not a grange. RODERIGO Most grave Brabantio, In simple and pure soul I come to you. IAGO 'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans. BRABANTIO What profane wretch art thou? IAGO I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs. BRABANTIO Thou art a villain. IAGO You are--a senator. BRABANTIO This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. RODERIGO Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you, If't be your pleasure and most wise consent, As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter, At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night, Transported, with no worse nor better guard But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor-- If this be known to you and your allowance, We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; But if you know not this, my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe That, from the sense of all civility, I thus would play and trifle with your reverence: Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, I say again, hath made a gross revolt; Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes In an extravagant and wheeling stranger Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself: If she be in her chamber or your house, Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you. BRABANTIO Strike on the tinder, ho! Give me a taper! call up all my people! This accident is not unlike my dream: Belief of it oppresses me already. Light, I say! light! Exit above  IAGO Farewell; for I must leave you: It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall-- Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state, However this may gall him with some cheque, Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls, Another of his fathom they have none, To lead their business: in which regard, Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains. Yet, for necessity of present life, I must show out a flag and sign of love, Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, Lead to the Sagittary the raised search; And there will I be with him. So, farewell. Exit  Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches  BRABANTIO It is too true an evil: gone she is; And what's to come of my despised time Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl! With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers: Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you? RODERIGO Truly, I think they are. BRABANTIO O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds By what you see them act. Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, Of some such thing? RODERIGO Yes, sir, I have indeed. BRABANTIO Call up my brother. O, would you had had her! Some one way, some another. Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? RODERIGO I think I can discover him, if you please, To get good guard and go along with me. BRABANTIO Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call; I may command at most. Get weapons, ho! And raise some special officers of night. On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains. Exeunt  SCENE II. Another street. Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches IAGO Though in the trade of war I have slain men, Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. OTHELLO 'Tis better as it is. IAGO Nay, but he prated, And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honour That, with the little godliness I have, I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir, Are you fast married? Be assured of this, That the magnifico is much beloved, And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the duke's: he will divorce you; Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law, with all his might to enforce it on, Will give him cable. OTHELLO Let him do his spite: My services which I have done the signiory Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,-- Which, when I know that boasting is an honour, I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being From men of royal siege, and my demerits May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago, But that I love the gentle Desdemona, I would not my unhoused free condition Put into circumscription and confine For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond? IAGO Those are the raised father and his friends: You were best go in. OTHELLO Not I I must be found: My parts, my title and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? IAGO By Janus, I think no. Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches  OTHELLO The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant. The goodness of the night upon you, friends! What is the news? CASSIO The duke does greet you, general, And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance, Even on the instant. OTHELLO What is the matter, think you? CASSIO Something from Cyprus as I may divine: It is a business of some heat: the galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another's heels, And many of the consuls, raised and met, Are at the duke's already: you have been hotly call'd for; When, being not at your lodging to be found, The senate hath sent about three several guests To search you out. OTHELLO 'Tis well I am found by you. I will but spend a word here in the house, And go with you. Exit  CASSIO Ancient, what makes he here? IAGO 'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack: If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever. CASSIO I do not understand. IAGO He's married. CASSIO To who? Re-enter OTHELLO  IAGO Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go? OTHELLO Have with you. CASSIO Here comes another troop to seek for you. IAGO It is Brabantio. General, be advised; He comes to bad intent. Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons  OTHELLO Holla! stand there! RODERIGO Signior, it is the Moor. BRABANTIO Down with him, thief! They draw on both sides  IAGO You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you. OTHELLO Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. Good signior, you shall more command with years Than with your weapons. BRABANTIO O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter? Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her; For I'll refer me to all things of sense, If she in chains of magic were not bound, Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy, So opposite to marriage that she shunned The wealthy curled darlings of our nation, Would ever have, to incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight. Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense That thou hast practised on her with foul charms, Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on; 'Tis probable and palpable to thinking. I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world, a practiser Of arts inhibited and out of warrant. Lay hold upon him: if he do resist, Subdue him at his peril. OTHELLO Hold your hands, Both you of my inclining, and the rest: Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it Without a prompter. Where will you that I go To answer this your charge? BRABANTIO To prison, till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer. OTHELLO What if I do obey? How may the duke be therewith satisfied, Whose messengers are here about my side, Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him? First Officer 'Tis true, most worthy signior; The duke's in council and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for. BRABANTIO How! the duke in council! In this time of the night! Bring him away: Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself, Or any of my brothers of the state, Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own; For if such actions may have passage free, Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be. Exeunt  SCENE III. A council-chamber. The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending DUKE OF VENICE There is no composition in these news That gives them credit. First Senator Indeed, they are disproportion'd; My letters say a hundred and seven galleys. DUKE OF VENICE And mine, a hundred and forty. Second Senator And mine, two hundred: But though they jump not on a just account,-- As in these cases, where the aim reports, 'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus. DUKE OF VENICE Nay, it is possible enough to judgment: I do not so secure me in the error, But the main article I do approve In fearful sense. Sailor [Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho! First Officer A messenger from the galleys. Enter a Sailor  DUKE OF VENICE Now, what's the business? Sailor The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes; So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo. DUKE OF VENICE How say you by this change? First Senator This cannot be, By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant, To keep us in false gaze. When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk, And let ourselves again but understand, That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes, So may he with more facile question bear it, For that it stands not in such warlike brace, But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this, We must not think the Turk is so unskilful To leave that latest which concerns him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain, To wake and wage a danger profitless. DUKE OF VENICE Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes. First Officer Here is more news. Enter a Messenger  Messenger The Ottomites, reverend and gracious, Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes, Have there injointed them with an after fleet. First Senator Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess? Messenger Of thirty sail: and now they do restem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, Your trusty and most valiant servitor, With his free duty recommends you thus, And prays you to believe him. DUKE OF VENICE 'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus. Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town? First Senator He's now in Florence. DUKE OF VENICE Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch. First Senator Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor. Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers  DUKE OF VENICE Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman. To BRABANTIO  I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior; We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight. BRABANTIO So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me; Neither my place nor aught I heard of business Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care Take hold on me, for my particular grief Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows And it is still itself. DUKE OF VENICE Why, what's the matter? BRABANTIO My daughter! O, my daughter! DUKE OF VENICE Senator Dead? BRABANTIO Ay, to me; She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks; For nature so preposterously to err, Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, Sans witchcraft could not. DUKE OF VENICE Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her, the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense, yea, though our proper son Stood in your action. BRABANTIO Humbly I thank your grace. Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems, Your special mandate for the state-affairs Hath hither brought. DUKE OF VENICE Senator We are very sorry for't. DUKE OF VENICE [To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this? BRABANTIO Nothing, but this is so. OTHELLO Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, My very noble and approved good masters, That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, It is most true; true, I have married her: The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace: For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used Their dearest action in the tented field, And little of this great world can I speak, More than pertains to feats of broil and battle, And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms, What conjuration and what mighty magic, For such proceeding I am charged withal, I won his daughter. BRABANTIO A maiden never bold; Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature, Of years, of country, credit, every thing, To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on! It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature, and must be driven To find out practises of cunning hell, Why this should be. I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, Or with some dram conjured to this effect, He wrought upon her. DUKE OF VENICE To vouch this, is no proof, Without more wider and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him. First Senator But, Othello, speak: Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid's affections? Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth? OTHELLO I do beseech you, Send for the lady to the Sagittary, And let her speak of me before her father: If you do find me foul in her report, The trust, the office I do hold of you, Not only take away, but let your sentence Even fall upon my life. DUKE OF VENICE Fetch Desdemona hither. OTHELLO Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place. Exeunt IAGO and Attendants  And, till she come, as truly as to heaven I do confess the vices of my blood, So justly to your grave ears I'll present How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, And she in mine. DUKE OF VENICE Say it, Othello. OTHELLO Her father loved me; oft invited me; Still question'd me the story of my life, From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed. I ran it through, even from my boyish days, To the very moment that he bade me tell it; Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents by flood and field Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach, Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence And portance in my travels' history: Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speak,--such was the process; And of the Cannibals that each other eat, The Anthropophagi and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline: But still the house-affairs would draw her thence: Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse: which I observing, Took once a pliant hour, and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard, But not intentively: I did consent, And often did beguile her of her tears, When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, She gave me for my pains a world of sighs: She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange, 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful: She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me, And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, I should but teach him how to tell my story. And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd, And I loved her that she did pity them. This only is the witchcraft I have used: Here comes the lady; let her witness it. Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants  DUKE OF VENICE I think this tale would win my daughter too. Good Brabantio, Take up this mangled matter at the best: Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands. BRABANTIO I pray you, hear her speak: If she confess that she was half the wooer, Destruction on my head, if my bad blame Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress: Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience? DESDEMONA My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty: To you I am bound for life and education; My life and education both do learn me How to respect you; you are the lord of duty; I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband, And so much duty as my mother show'd To you, preferring you before her father, So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord. BRABANTIO God be wi' you! I have done. Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs: I had rather to adopt a child than get it. Come hither, Moor: I here do give thee that with all my heart Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul I have no other child: For thy escape would teach me tyranny, To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. DUKE OF VENICE Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence, Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers Into your favour. When remedies are past, the griefs are ended By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on. What cannot be preserved when fortune takes Patience her injury a mockery makes. The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. BRABANTIO So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; We lose it not, so long as we can smile. He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears, But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, Being strong on both sides, are equivocal: But words are words; I never yet did hear That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. DUKE OF VENICE The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition. OTHELLO The tyrant custom, most grave senators, Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness, and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites. Most humbly therefore bending to your state, I crave fit disposition for my wife. Due reference of place and exhibition, With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding. DUKE OF VENICE If you please, Be't at her father's. BRABANTIO I'll not have it so. OTHELLO Nor I. DESDEMONA Nor I; I would not there reside, To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye. Most gracious duke, To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear; And let me find a charter in your voice, To assist my simpleness. DUKE OF VENICE What would You, Desdemona? DESDEMONA That I did love the Moor to live with him, My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued Even to the very quality of my lord: I saw Othello's visage in his mind, And to his honour and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, A moth of peace, and he go to the war, The rites for which I love him are bereft me, And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence. Let me go with him. OTHELLO Let her have your voices. Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not, To please the palate of my appetite, Nor to comply with heat--the young affects In me defunct--and proper satisfaction. But to be free and bounteous to her mind: And heaven defend your good souls, that you think I will your serious and great business scant For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness My speculative and officed instruments, That my disports corrupt and taint my business, Let housewives make a skillet of my helm, And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation! DUKE OF VENICE Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste, And speed must answer it. First Senator You must away to-night. OTHELLO With all my heart. DUKE OF VENICE At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again. Othello, leave some officer behind, And he shall our commission bring to you; With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you. OTHELLO So please your grace, my ancient; A man he is of honest and trust: To his conveyance I assign my wife, With what else needful your good grace shall think To be sent after me. DUKE OF VENICE Let it be so. Good night to every one. To BRABANTIO  And, noble signior, If virtue no delighted beauty lack, Your son-in-law is far more fair than black. First Senator Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well. BRABANTIO Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see: She has deceived her father, and may thee. Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, & c  OTHELLO My life upon her faith! Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee: I prithee, let thy wife attend on her: And bring them after in the best advantage. Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour Of love, of worldly matters and direction, To spend with thee: we must obey the time. Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA  RODERIGO Iago,-- IAGO What say'st thou, noble heart? RODERIGO What will I do, thinkest thou? IAGO Why, go to bed, and sleep. RODERIGO I will incontinently drown myself. IAGO If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, thou silly gentleman! RODERIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician. IAGO O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years; and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon. RODERIGO What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it. IAGO Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions: but we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion. RODERIGO It cannot be. IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice: she must have change, she must: therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her. RODERIGO Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue? IAGO Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered. Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more of this to-morrow. Adieu. RODERIGO Where shall we meet i' the morning? IAGO At my lodging. RODERIGO I'll be with thee betimes. IAGO Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? RODERIGO What say you? IAGO No more of drowning, do you hear? RODERIGO I am changed: I'll go sell all my land. Exit  IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse: For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, If I would time expend with such a snipe. But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor: And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets He has done my office: I know not if't be true; But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, Will do as if for surety. He holds me well; The better shall my purpose work on him. Cassio's a proper man: let me see now: To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:-- After some time, to abuse Othello's ear That he is too familiar with his wife. He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected, framed to make women false. The Moor is of a free and open nature, That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are. I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. Exit  ACT II SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay. Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen MONTANO What from the cape can you discern at sea? First Gentleman Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood; I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main, Descry a sail. MONTANO Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements: If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea, What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this? Second Gentleman A segregation of the Turkish fleet: For do but stand upon the foaming shore, The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, seems to cast water on the burning bear, And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole: I never did like molestation view On the enchafed flood. MONTANO If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd: It is impossible they bear it out. Enter a third Gentleman  Third Gentleman News, lads! our wars are done. The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks, That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet. MONTANO How! is this true? Third Gentleman The ship is here put in, A Veronesa; Michael Cassio, Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea, And is in full commission here for Cyprus. MONTANO I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor. Third Gentleman But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly, And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted With foul and violent tempest. MONTANO Pray heavens he be; For I have served him, and the man commands Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho! As well to see the vessel that's come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, Even till we make the main and the aerial blue An indistinct regard. Third Gentleman Come, let's do so: For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance. Enter CASSIO  CASSIO Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle, That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens Give him defence against the elements, For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea. MONTANO Is he well shipp'd? CASSIO His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance; Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death, Stand in bold cure. A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'  Enter a fourth Gentleman  CASSIO What noise? Fourth Gentleman The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!' CASSIO My hopes do shape him for the governor. Guns heard  Second Gentlemen They do discharge their shot of courtesy: Our friends at least. CASSIO I pray you, sir, go forth, And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived. Second Gentleman I shall. Exit  MONTANO But, good lieutenant, is your general wived? CASSIO Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid That paragons description and wild fame; One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens, And in the essential vesture of creation Does tire the ingener. Re-enter second Gentleman  How now! who has put in? Second Gentleman 'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general. CASSIO Has had most favourable and happy speed: Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds, The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands-- Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,-- As having sense of beauty, do omit Their mortal natures, letting go safely by The divine Desdemona. MONTANO What is she? CASSIO She that I spake of, our great captain's captain, Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard, And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, That he may bless this bay with his tall ship, Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms, Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort! Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants  O, behold, The riches of the ship is come on shore! Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees. Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven, Before, behind thee, and on every hand, Enwheel thee round! DESDEMONA I thank you, valiant Cassio. What tidings can you tell me of my lord? CASSIO He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught But that he's well and will be shortly here. DESDEMONA O, but I fear--How lost you company? CASSIO The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail. Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard  Second Gentleman They give their greeting to the citadel; This likewise is a friend. CASSIO See for the news. Exit Gentleman  Good ancient, you are welcome. To EMILIA  Welcome, mistress. Let it not gall your patience, good Iago, That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding That gives me this bold show of courtesy. Kissing her  IAGO Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You'll have enough. DESDEMONA Alas, she has no speech. IAGO In faith, too much; I find it still, when I have list to sleep: Marry, before your ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart, And chides with thinking. EMILIA You have little cause to say so. IAGO Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors, Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, Saints m your injuries, devils being offended, Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds. DESDEMONA O, fie upon thee, slanderer! IAGO Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk: You rise to play and go to bed to work. EMILIA You shall not write my praise. IAGO No, let me not. DESDEMONA What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me? IAGO O gentle lady, do not put me to't; For I am nothing, if not critical. DESDEMONA Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour? IAGO Ay, madam. DESDEMONA I am not merry; but I do beguile The thing I am, by seeming otherwise. Come, how wouldst thou praise me? IAGO I am about it; but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize; It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours, And thus she is deliver'd. If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit, The one's for use, the other useth it. DESDEMONA Well praised! How if she be black and witty? IAGO If she be black, and thereto have a wit, She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit. DESDEMONA Worse and worse. EMILIA How if fair and foolish? IAGO She never yet was foolish that was fair; For even her folly help'd her to an heir. DESDEMONA These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish? IAGO There's none so foul and foolish thereunto, But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do. DESDEMONA O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself? IAGO She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,' She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail; She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wight were,-- DESDEMONA To do what? IAGO To suckle fools and chronicle small beer. DESDEMONA O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor? CASSIO He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar. IAGO [Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said, whisper: with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake! Trumpet within  The Moor! I know his trumpet. CASSIO 'Tis truly so. DESDEMONA Let's meet him and receive him. CASSIO Lo, where he comes! Enter OTHELLO and Attendants  OTHELLO O my fair warrior! DESDEMONA My dear Othello! OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me. O my soul's joy! If after every tempest come such calms, May the winds blow till they have waken'd death! And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas Olympus-high and duck again as low As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear, My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate. DESDEMONA The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase, Even as our days do grow! OTHELLO Amen to that, sweet powers! I cannot speak enough of this content; It stops me here; it is too much of joy: And this, and this, the greatest discords be Kissing her  That e'er our hearts shall make! IAGO [Aside] O, you are well tuned now! But I'll set down the pegs that make this music, As honest as I am. OTHELLO Come, let us to the castle. News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd. How does my old acquaintance of this isle? Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus; I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago, Go to the bay and disembark my coffers: Bring thou the master to the citadel; He is a good one, and his worthiness Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona, Once more, well met at Cyprus. Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants  IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them--list me. The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is directly in love with him. RODERIGO With him! why, 'tis not possible. IAGO Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies: and will she love him still for prating? let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most pregnant and unforced position--who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman hath found him already. RODERIGO I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blessed condition. IAGO Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst not mark that? RODERIGO Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. IAGO Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, the incorporate conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favourably minister. RODERIGO Well. IAGO Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably removed, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity. RODERIGO I will do this, if I can bring it to any opportunity. IAGO I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell. RODERIGO Adieu. Exit  IAGO That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it; That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit: The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too; Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin, But partly led to diet my revenge, For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards; And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife, Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb-- For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too-- Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me. For making him egregiously an ass And practising upon his peace and quiet Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused: Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used. Exit  SCENE II. A street. Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following Herald It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph; some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these beneficial news, it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello! Exeunt  SCENE III. A hall in the castle. Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants OTHELLO Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night: Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop, Not to outsport discretion. CASSIO Iago hath direction what to do; But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye Will I look to't. OTHELLO Iago is most honest. Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you. To DESDEMONA  Come, my dear love, The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you. Good night. Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants  Enter IAGO  CASSIO Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch. IAGO Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and she is sport for Jove. CASSIO She's a most exquisite lady. IAGO And, I'll warrant her, fun of game. CASSIO Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature. IAGO What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of provocation. CASSIO An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest. IAGO And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love? CASSIO She is indeed perfection. IAGO Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello. CASSIO Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment. IAGO O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for you. CASSIO I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity, and dare not task my weakness with any more. IAGO What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants desire it. CASSIO Where are they? IAGO Here at the door; I pray you, call them in. CASSIO I'll do't; but it dislikes me. Exit  IAGO If I can fasten but one cup upon him, With that which he hath drunk to-night already, He'll be as full of quarrel and offence As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo, Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out, To Desdemona hath to-night caroused Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch: Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits, That hold their honours in a wary distance, The very elements of this warlike isle, Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups, And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards, Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle.--But here they come: If consequence do but approve my dream, My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream. Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine  CASSIO 'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already. MONTANO Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am a soldier. IAGO Some wine, ho! Sings  And let me the canakin clink, clink; And let me the canakin clink A soldier's a man; A life's but a span; Why, then, let a soldier drink. Some wine, boys! CASSIO 'Fore God, an excellent song. IAGO I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing to your English. CASSIO Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking? IAGO Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle can be filled. CASSIO To the health of our general! MONTANO I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice. IAGO O sweet England! King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown; He held them sixpence all too dear, With that he call'd the tailor lown. He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree: 'Tis pride that pulls the country down; Then take thine auld cloak about thee. Some wine, ho! CASSIO Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other. IAGO Will you hear't again? CASSIO No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things. Well, God's above all; and there be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved. IAGO It's true, good lieutenant. CASSIO For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor any man of quality,--I hope to be saved. IAGO And so do I too, lieutenant. CASSIO Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business. Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left: I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and speak well enough. All Excellent well. CASSIO Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk. Exit  MONTANO To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch. IAGO You see this fellow that is gone before; He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar And give direction: and do but see his vice; 'Tis to his virtue a just equinox, The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him. I fear the trust Othello puts him in. On some odd time of his infirmity, Will shake this island. MONTANO But is he often thus? IAGO 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep: He'll watch the horologe a double set, If drink rock not his cradle. MONTANO It were well The general were put in mind of it. Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio, And looks not on his evils: is not this true? Enter RODERIGO  IAGO [Aside to him] How now, Roderigo! I pray you, after the lieutenant; go. Exit RODERIGO  MONTANO And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity: It were an honest action to say So to the Moor. IAGO Not I, for this fair island: I do love Cassio well; and would do much To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise? Cry within: 'Help! help!'  Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO  CASSIO You rogue! you rascal! MONTANO What's the matter, lieutenant? CASSIO A knave teach me my duty! I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle. RODERIGO Beat me! CASSIO Dost thou prate, rogue? Striking RODERIGO  MONTANO Nay, good lieutenant; Staying him  I pray you, sir, hold your hand. CASSIO Let me go, sir, Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard. MONTANO Come, come, you're drunk. CASSIO Drunk! They fight  IAGO [Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny. Exit RODERIGO  Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;-- Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir; Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed! Bell rings  Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho! The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold! You will be shamed for ever. Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants  OTHELLO What is the matter here? MONTANO 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death. Faints  OTHELLO Hold, for your lives! IAGO Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,-- Have you forgot all sense of place and duty? Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame! OTHELLO Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this? Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites? For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl: He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion. Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle From her propriety. What is the matter, masters? Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving, Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee. IAGO I do not know: friends all but now, even now, In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed; and then, but now-- As if some planet had unwitted men-- Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast, In opposition bloody. I cannot speak Any beginning to this peevish odds; And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it! OTHELLO How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot? CASSIO I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak. OTHELLO Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil; The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted, and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter, That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it. MONTANO Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger: Your officer, Iago, can inform you,-- While I spare speech, which something now offends me,-- Of all that I do know: nor know I aught By me that's said or done amiss this night; Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice, And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us. OTHELLO Now, by heaven, My blood begins my safer guides to rule; And passion, having my best judgment collied, Assays to lead the way: if I once stir, Or do but lift this arm, the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know How this foul rout began, who set it on; And he that is approved in this offence, Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth, Shall lose me. What! in a town of war, Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, To manage private and domestic quarrel, In night, and on the court and guard of safety! 'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't? MONTANO If partially affined, or leagued in office, Thou dost deliver more or less than truth, Thou art no soldier. IAGO Touch me not so near: I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio; Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general. Montano and myself being in speech, There comes a fellow crying out for help: And Cassio following him with determined sword, To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause: Myself the crying fellow did pursue, Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out-- The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot, Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords, And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night I ne'er might say before. When I came back-- For this was brief--I found them close together, At blow and thrust; even as again they were When you yourself did part them. More of this matter cannot I report: But men are men; the best sometimes forget: Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received From him that fled some strange indignity, Which patience could not pass. OTHELLO I know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee But never more be officer of mine. Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended  Look, if my gentle love be not raised up! I'll make thee an example. DESDEMONA What's the matter? OTHELLO All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed. Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon: Lead him off. To MONTANO, who is led off  Iago, look with care about the town, And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted. Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife. Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO  IAGO What, are you hurt, lieutenant? CASSIO Ay, past all surgery. IAGO Marry, heaven forbid! CASSIO Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation! IAGO As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general again: you are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue to him again, and he's yours. CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil! IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you? CASSIO I know not. IAGO Is't possible? CASSIO I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts! IAGO Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered? CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself. IAGO Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen; but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. CASSIO I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil. IAGO Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used: exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you. CASSIO I have well approved it, sir. I drunk! IAGO You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife is now the general: may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again: she is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested: this broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before. CASSIO You advise me well. IAGO I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. CASSIO I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me: I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here. IAGO You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I must to the watch. CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago. Exit  IAGO And what's he then that says I play the villain? When this advice is free I give and honest, Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful As the free elements. And then for her To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism, All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, His soul is so enfetter'd to her love, That she may make, unmake, do what she list, Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function. How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! When devils will the blackest sins put on, They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, As I do now: for whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, I'll pour this pestilence into his ear, That she repeals him for her body's lust; And by how much she strives to do him good, She shall undo her credit with the Moor. So will I turn her virtue into pitch, And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all. Re-enter RODERIGO  How now, Roderigo! RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall have so much experience for my pains, and so, with no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice. IAGO How poor are they that have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees? Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft; And wit depends on dilatory time. Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee. And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio: Though other things grow fair against the sun, Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe: Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning; Pleasure and action make the hours seem short. Retire thee; go where thou art billeted: Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter: Nay, get thee gone. Exit RODERIGO  Two things are to be done: My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress; I'll set her on; Myself the while to draw the Moor apart, And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way Dull not device by coldness and delay. Exit  ACT III SCENE I. Before the castle. Enter CASSIO and some Musicians CASSIO Masters, play here; I will content your pains; Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.' Music  Enter Clown  Clown Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus? First Musician How, sir, how! Clown Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments? First Musician Ay, marry, are they, sir. Clown O, thereby hangs a tail. First Musician Whereby hangs a tale, sir? Clown Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it. First Musician Well, sir, we will not. Clown If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again: but, as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care. First Musician We have none such, sir. Clown Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away: go; vanish into air; away! Exeunt Musicians  CASSIO Dost thou hear, my honest friend? Clown No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you. CASSIO Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech: wilt thou do this? Clown She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her. CASSIO Do, good my friend. Exit Clown  Enter IAGO  In happy time, Iago. IAGO You have not been a-bed, then? CASSIO Why, no; the day had broke Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago, To send in to your wife: my suit to her Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access. IAGO I'll send her to you presently; And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way, that your converse and business May be more free. CASSIO I humbly thank you for't. Exit IAGO  I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest. Enter EMILIA  EMILIA Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry For your displeasure; but all will sure be well. The general and his wife are talking of it; And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies, That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus, And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again. CASSIO Yet, I beseech you, If you think fit, or that it may be done, Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone. EMILIA Pray you, come in; I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely. CASSIO I am much bound to you. Exeunt  SCENE II. A room in the castle. Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen OTHELLO These letters give, Iago, to the pilot; And by him do my duties to the senate: That done, I will be walking on the works; Repair there to me. IAGO Well, my good lord, I'll do't. OTHELLO This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't? Gentleman We'll wait upon your lordship. Exeunt  SCENE III. The garden of the castle. Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA DESDEMONA Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do All my abilities in thy behalf. EMILIA Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband, As if the case were his. DESDEMONA O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were. CASSIO Bounteous madam, Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, He's never any thing but your true servant. DESDEMONA I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord: You have known him long; and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no further off Than in a polite distance. CASSIO Ay, but, lady, That policy may either last so long, Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, Or breed itself so out of circumstance, That, I being absent and my place supplied, My general will forget my love and service. DESDEMONA Do not doubt that; before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee, If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it To the last article: my lord shall never rest; I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; I'll intermingle every thing he does With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio; For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away. EMILIA Madam, here comes my lord. CASSIO Madam, I'll take my leave. DESDEMONA Why, stay, and hear me speak. CASSIO Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes. DESDEMONA Well, do your discretion. Exit CASSIO  Enter OTHELLO and IAGO  IAGO Ha! I like not that. OTHELLO What dost thou say? IAGO Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what. OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? IAGO Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it, That he would steal away so guilty-like, Seeing you coming. OTHELLO I do believe 'twas he. DESDEMONA How now, my lord! I have been talking with a suitor here, A man that languishes in your displeasure. OTHELLO Who is't you mean? DESDEMONA Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, If I have any grace or power to move you, His present reconciliation take; For if he be not one that truly loves you, That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, I have no judgment in an honest face: I prithee, call him back. OTHELLO Went he hence now? DESDEMONA Ay, sooth; so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me, To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. OTHELLO Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time. DESDEMONA But shall't be shortly? OTHELLO The sooner, sweet, for you. DESDEMONA Shall't be to-night at supper? OTHELLO No, not to-night. DESDEMONA To-morrow dinner, then? OTHELLO I shall not dine at home; I meet the captains at the citadel. DESDEMONA Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn: I prithee, name the time, but let it not Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent; And yet his trespass, in our common reason-- Save that, they say, the wars must make examples Out of their best--is not almost a fault To incur a private cheque. When shall he come? Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul, What you would ask me, that I should deny, Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio, That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,-- OTHELLO Prithee, no more: let him come when he will; I will deny thee nothing. DESDEMONA Why, this is not a boon; 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person: nay, when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted. OTHELLO I will deny thee nothing: Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leave me but a little to myself. DESDEMONA Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord. OTHELLO Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight. DESDEMONA Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you; Whate'er you be, I am obedient. Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA  OTHELLO Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul, But I do love thee! and when I love thee not, Chaos is come again. IAGO My noble lord-- OTHELLO What dost thou say, Iago? IAGO Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady, Know of your love? OTHELLO He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask? IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought; No further harm. OTHELLO Why of thy thought, Iago? IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her. OTHELLO O, yes; and went between us very oft. IAGO Indeed! OTHELLO Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that? Is he not honest? IAGO Honest, my lord! OTHELLO Honest! ay, honest. IAGO My lord, for aught I know. OTHELLO What dost thou think? IAGO Think, my lord! OTHELLO Think, my lord! By heaven, he echoes me, As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something: I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that, When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like? And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!' And didst contract and purse thy brow together, As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me, Show me thy thought. IAGO My lord, you know I love you. OTHELLO I think thou dost; And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty, And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more: For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just They are close delations, working from the heart That passion cannot rule. IAGO For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. OTHELLO I think so too. IAGO Men should be what they seem; Or those that be not, would they might seem none! OTHELLO Certain, men should be what they seem. IAGO Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man. OTHELLO Nay, yet there's more in this: I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words. IAGO Good my lord, pardon me: Though I am bound to every act of duty, I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; As where's that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure, But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law-days and in session sit With meditations lawful? OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear A stranger to thy thoughts. IAGO I do beseech you-- Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, As, I confess, it is my nature's plague To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet, From one that so imperfectly conceits, Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance. It were not for your quiet nor your good, Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom, To let you know my thoughts. OTHELLO What dost thou mean? IAGO Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, Is the immediate jewel of their souls: Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands: But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed. OTHELLO By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts. IAGO You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody. OTHELLO Ha! IAGO O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves! OTHELLO O misery! IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough, But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor. Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy! OTHELLO Why, why is this? Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy, To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat, When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well; Where virtue is, these are more virtuous: Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago; I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And on the proof, there is no more but this,-- Away at once with love or jealousy! IAGO I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure: I would not have your free and noble nature, Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't: I know our country disposition well; In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown. OTHELLO Dost thou say so? IAGO She did deceive her father, marrying you; And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks, She loved them most. OTHELLO And so she did. IAGO Why, go to then; She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, To seal her father's eyes up close as oak- He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame; I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you. OTHELLO I am bound to thee for ever. IAGO I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits. OTHELLO Not a jot, not a jot. IAGO I' faith, I fear it has. I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved: I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion. OTHELLO I will not. IAGO Should you do so, my lord, My speech should fall into such vile success As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-- My lord, I see you're moved. OTHELLO No, not much moved: I do not think but Desdemona's honest. IAGO Long live she so! and long live you to think so! OTHELLO And yet, how nature erring from itself,-- IAGO Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you-- Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, Whereto we see in all things nature tends-- Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank, Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural. But pardon me; I do not in position Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent. OTHELLO Farewell, farewell: If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago: IAGO [Going] My lord, I take my leave. OTHELLO Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. IAGO [Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour To scan this thing no further; leave it to time: Though it be fit that Cassio have his place, For sure, he fills it up with great ability, Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, You shall by that perceive him and his means: Note, if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity; Much will be seen in that. In the mean time, Let me be thought too busy in my fears-- As worthy cause I have to fear I am-- And hold her free, I do beseech your honour. OTHELLO Fear not my government. IAGO I once more take my leave. Exit  OTHELLO This fellow's of exceeding honesty, And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit, Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard, Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind, To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have, or for I am declined Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much-- She's gone. I am abused; and my relief Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage, That we can call these delicate creatures ours, And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad, And live upon the vapour of a dungeon, Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; Prerogatived are they less than the base; 'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death: Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken. Desdemona comes: Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA  If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself! I'll not believe't. DESDEMONA How now, my dear Othello! Your dinner, and the generous islanders By you invited, do attend your presence. OTHELLO I am to blame. DESDEMONA Why do you speak so faintly? Are you not well? OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead here. DESDEMONA 'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again: Let me but bind it hard, within this hour It will be well. OTHELLO Your napkin is too little: He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops  Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you. DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well. Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA  EMILIA I am glad I have found this napkin: This was her first remembrance from the Moor: My wayward husband hath a hundred times Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, For he conjured her she should ever keep it, That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out, And give't Iago: what he will do with it Heaven knows, not I; I nothing but to please his fantasy. Re-enter Iago  IAGO How now! what do you here alone? EMILIA Do not you chide; I have a thing for you. IAGO A thing for me? it is a common thing-- EMILIA Ha! IAGO To have a foolish wife. EMILIA O, is that all? What will you give me now For the same handkerchief? IAGO What handkerchief? EMILIA What handkerchief? Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona; That which so often you did bid me steal. IAGO Hast stol'n it from her? EMILIA No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence. And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up. Look, here it is. IAGO A good wench; give it me. EMILIA What will you do with 't, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it? IAGO [Snatching it] Why, what's that to you? EMILIA If it be not for some purpose of import, Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad When she shall lack it. IAGO Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it. Go, leave me. Exit EMILIA  I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin, And let him find it. Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ: this may do something. The Moor already changes with my poison: Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons. Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, But with a little act upon the blood. Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so: Look, where he comes! Re-enter OTHELLO  Not poppy, nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou owedst yesterday. OTHELLO Ha! ha! false to me? IAGO Why, how now, general! no more of that. OTHELLO Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack: I swear 'tis better to be much abused Than but to know't a little. IAGO How now, my lord! OTHELLO What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust? I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me: I slept the next night well, was free and merry; I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips: He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n, Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all. IAGO I am sorry to hear this. OTHELLO I had been happy, if the general camp, Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content! Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars, That make ambition virtue! O, farewell! Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump, The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, The royal banner, and all quality, Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war! And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit, Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone! IAGO Is't possible, my lord? OTHELLO Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore, Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof: Or by the worth of man's eternal soul, Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath! IAGO Is't come to this? OTHELLO Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it, That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life! IAGO My noble lord,-- OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me, Never pray more; abandon all remorse; On horror's head horrors accumulate; Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed; For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that. IAGO O grace! O heaven forgive me! Are you a man? have you a soul or sense? God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool. That livest to make thine honesty a vice! O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world, To be direct and honest is not safe. I thank you for this profit; and from hence I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence. OTHELLO Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest. IAGO I should be wise, for honesty's a fool And loses that it works for. OTHELLO By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not; I think that thou art just and think thou art not. I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives, Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied! IAGO I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion: I do repent me that I put it to you. You would be satisfied? OTHELLO Would! nay, I will. IAGO And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord? Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on-- Behold her topp'd? OTHELLO Death and damnation! O! IAGO It were a tedious difficulty, I think, To bring them to that prospect: damn them then, If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own! What then? how then? What shall I say? Where's satisfaction? It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say, If imputation and strong circumstances, Which lead directly to the door of truth, Will give you satisfaction, you may have't. OTHELLO Give me a living reason she's disloyal. IAGO I do not like the office: But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far, Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love, I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately; And, being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleep. There are a kind of men so loose of soul, That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs: One of this kind is Cassio: In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona, Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;' And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard, As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!' OTHELLO O monstrous! monstrous! IAGO Nay, this was but his dream. OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion: 'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly. OTHELLO I'll tear her all to pieces. IAGO Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done; She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? OTHELLO I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. IAGO I know not that; but such a handkerchief-- I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day See Cassio wipe his beard with. OTHELLO If it be that-- IAGO If it be that, or any that was hers, It speaks against her with the other proofs. OTHELLO O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago; All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. 'Tis gone. Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell! Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues! IAGO Yet be content. OTHELLO O, blood, blood, blood! IAGO Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change. OTHELLO Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea, Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont, Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace, Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven, Kneels  In the due reverence of a sacred vow I here engage my words. IAGO Do not rise yet. Kneels  Witness, you ever-burning lights above, You elements that clip us round about, Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody business ever. They rise  OTHELLO I greet thy love, Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous, And will upon the instant put thee to't: Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio's not alive. IAGO My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: But let her live. OTHELLO Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw, To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. IAGO I am your own for ever. Exeunt  SCENE IV. Before the castle. Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown DESDEMONA Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies? Clown I dare not say he lies any where. DESDEMONA Why, man? Clown He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing. DESDEMONA Go to: where lodges he? Clown To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie. DESDEMONA Can any thing be made of this? Clown I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat. DESDEMONA Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report? Clown I will catechise the world for him; that is, make questions, and by them answer. DESDEMONA Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well. Clown To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and therefore I will attempt the doing it. Exit  DESDEMONA Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia? EMILIA I know not, madam. DESDEMONA Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill thinking. EMILIA Is he not jealous? DESDEMONA Who, he? I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humours from him. EMILIA Look, where he comes. DESDEMONA I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call'd to him. Enter OTHELLO  How is't with you, my lord OTHELLO Well, my good lady. Aside  O, hardness to dissemble!-- How do you, Desdemona? DESDEMONA Well, my good lord. OTHELLO Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady. DESDEMONA It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow. OTHELLO This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart: Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer, Much castigation, exercise devout; For here's a young and sweating devil here, That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand, A frank one. DESDEMONA You may, indeed, say so; For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart. OTHELLO A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands; But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts. DESDEMONA I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise. OTHELLO What promise, chuck? DESDEMONA I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you. OTHELLO I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me; Lend me thy handkerchief. DESDEMONA Here, my lord. OTHELLO That which I gave you. DESDEMONA I have it not about me. OTHELLO Not? DESDEMONA No, indeed, my lord. OTHELLO That is a fault. That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give; She was a charmer, and could almost read The thoughts of people: she told her, while she kept it, 'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love, but if she lost it Or made gift of it, my father's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me; And bid me, when my fate would have me wive, To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't; Make it a darling like your precious eye; To lose't or give't away were such perdition As nothing else could match. DESDEMONA Is't possible? OTHELLO 'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it: A sibyl, that had number'd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses, In her prophetic fury sew'd the work; The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk; And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful Conserved of maidens' hearts. DESDEMONA Indeed! is't true? OTHELLO Most veritable; therefore look to't well. DESDEMONA Then would to God that I had never seen't! OTHELLO Ha! wherefore? DESDEMONA Why do you speak so startingly and rash? OTHELLO Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way? DESDEMONA Heaven bless us! OTHELLO Say you? DESDEMONA It is not lost; but what an if it were? OTHELLO How! DESDEMONA I say, it is not lost. OTHELLO Fetch't, let me see't. DESDEMONA Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. This is a trick to put me from my suit: Pray you, let Cassio be received again. OTHELLO Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives. DESDEMONA Come, come; You'll never meet a more sufficient man. OTHELLO The handkerchief! DESDEMONA I pray, talk me of Cassio. OTHELLO The handkerchief! DESDEMONA A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love, Shared dangers with you,-- OTHELLO The handkerchief! DESDEMONA In sooth, you are to blame. OTHELLO Away! Exit  EMILIA Is not this man jealous? DESDEMONA I ne'er saw this before. Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief: I am most unhappy in the loss of it. EMILIA 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man: They are all but stomachs, and we all but food; To eat us hungerly, and when they are full, They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband! Enter CASSIO and IAGO  IAGO There is no other way; 'tis she must do't: And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her. DESDEMONA How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you? CASSIO Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist, and be a member of his love Whom I with all the office of my heart Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd. If my offence be of such mortal kind That nor my service past, nor present sorrows, Nor purposed merit in futurity, Can ransom me into his love again, But to know so must be my benefit; So shall I clothe me in a forced content, And shut myself up in some other course, To fortune's alms. DESDEMONA Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio! My advocation is not now in tune; My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him, Were he in favour as in humour alter'd. So help me every spirit sanctified, As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech! you must awhile be patient: What I can do I will; and more I will Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you. IAGO Is my lord angry? EMILIA He went hence but now, And certainly in strange unquietness. IAGO Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon, When it hath blown his ranks into the air, And, like the devil, from his very arm Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry? Something of moment then: I will go meet him: There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry. DESDEMONA I prithee, do so. Exit IAGO  Something, sure, of state, Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him, Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases Men's natures wrangle with inferior things, Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so; For let our finger ache, and it indues Our other healthful members even to that sense Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods, Nor of them look for such observances As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, I was, unhandsome warrior as I am, Arraigning his unkindness with my soul; But now I find I had suborn'd the witness, And he's indicted falsely. EMILIA Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think, And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you. DESDEMONA Alas the day! I never gave him cause. EMILIA But jealous souls will not be answer'd so; They are not ever jealous for the cause, But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster Begot upon itself, born on itself. DESDEMONA Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind! EMILIA Lady, amen. DESDEMONA I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout: If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost. CASSIO I humbly thank your ladyship. Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA  Enter BIANCA  BIANCA Save you, friend Cassio! CASSIO What make you from home? How is it with you, my most fair Bianca? I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house. BIANCA And I was going to your lodging, Cassio. What, keep a week away? seven days and nights? Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours, More tedious than the dial eight score times? O weary reckoning! CASSIO Pardon me, Bianca: I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd: But I shall, in a more continuate time, Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca, Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief  Take me this work out. BIANCA O Cassio, whence came this? This is some token from a newer friend: To the felt absence now I feel a cause: Is't come to this? Well, well. CASSIO Go to, woman! Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, From whence you have them. You are jealous now That this is from some mistress, some remembrance: No, in good troth, Bianca. BIANCA Why, whose is it? CASSIO I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber. I like the work well: ere it be demanded-- As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied: Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time. BIANCA Leave you! wherefore? CASSIO I do attend here on the general; And think it no addition, nor my wish, To have him see me woman'd. BIANCA Why, I pray you? CASSIO Not that I love you not. BIANCA But that you do not love me. I pray you, bring me on the way a little, And say if I shall see you soon at night. CASSIO 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you; For I attend here: but I'll see you soon. BIANCA 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced. Exeunt  ACT IV SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle. Enter OTHELLO and IAGO IAGO Will you think so? OTHELLO Think so, Iago! IAGO What, To kiss in private? OTHELLO An unauthorized kiss. IAGO Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more, not meaning any harm? OTHELLO Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm! It is hypocrisy against the devil: They that mean virtuously, and yet do so, The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven. IAGO So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip: But if I give my wife a handkerchief,-- OTHELLO What then? IAGO Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers, She may, I think, bestow't on any man. OTHELLO She is protectress of her honour too: May she give that? IAGO Her honour is an essence that's not seen; They have it very oft that have it not: But, for the handkerchief,-- OTHELLO By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it. Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory, As doth the raven o'er the infected house, Boding to all--he had my handkerchief. IAGO Ay, what of that? OTHELLO That's not so good now. IAGO What, If I had said I had seen him do you wrong? Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad, Who having, by their own importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some mistress, Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose But they must blab-- OTHELLO Hath he said any thing? IAGO He hath, my lord; but be you well assured, No more than he'll unswear. OTHELLO What hath he said? IAGO 'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did. OTHELLO What? what? IAGO Lie-- OTHELLO With her? IAGO With her, on her; what you will. OTHELLO Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome. --Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. --Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!-- Falls in a trance  IAGO Work on, My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught; And many worthy and chaste dames even thus, All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord! My lord, I say! Othello! Enter CASSIO  How now, Cassio! CASSIO What's the matter? IAGO My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy: This is his second fit; he had one yesterday. CASSIO Rub him about the temples. IAGO No, forbear; The lethargy must have his quiet course: If not, he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs: Do you withdraw yourself a little while, He will recover straight: when he is gone, I would on great occasion speak with you. Exit CASSIO  How is it, general? have you not hurt your head? OTHELLO Dost thou mock me? IAGO I mock you! no, by heaven. Would you would bear your fortune like a man! OTHELLO A horned man's a monster and a beast. IAGO There's many a beast then in a populous city, And many a civil monster. OTHELLO Did he confess it? IAGO Good sir, be a man; Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked May draw with you: there's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better. O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock, To lip a wanton in a secure couch, And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know; And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be. OTHELLO O, thou art wise; 'tis certain. IAGO Stand you awhile apart; Confine yourself but in a patient list. Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief-- A passion most unsuiting such a man-- Cassio came hither: I shifted him away, And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy, Bade him anon return and here speak with me; The which he promised. Do but encave yourself, And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, That dwell in every region of his face; For I will make him tell the tale anew, Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is again to cope your wife: I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience; Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen, And nothing of a man. OTHELLO Dost thou hear, Iago? I will be found most cunning in my patience; But--dost thou hear?--most bloody. IAGO That's not amiss; But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw? OTHELLO retires  Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A housewife that by selling her desires Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague To beguile many and be beguiled by one: He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain From the excess of laughter. Here he comes: Re-enter CASSIO  As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad; And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior, Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant? CASSIO The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me. IAGO Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't. Speaking lower  Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power, How quickly should you speed! CASSIO Alas, poor caitiff! OTHELLO Look, how he laughs already! IAGO I never knew woman love man so. CASSIO Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me. OTHELLO Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out. IAGO Do you hear, Cassio? OTHELLO Now he importunes him To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said. IAGO She gives it out that you shall marry hey: Do you intend it? CASSIO Ha, ha, ha! OTHELLO Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph? CASSIO I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha! OTHELLO So, so, so, so: they laugh that win. IAGO 'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her. CASSIO Prithee, say true. IAGO I am a very villain else. OTHELLO Have you scored me? Well. CASSIO This is the monkey's own giving out: she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise. OTHELLO Iago beckons me; now he begins the story. CASSIO She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck-- OTHELLO Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture imports it. CASSIO So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales, and pulls me: ha, ha, ha! OTHELLO Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to. CASSIO Well, I must leave her company. IAGO Before me! look, where she comes. CASSIO 'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one. Enter BIANCA  What do you mean by this haunting of me? BIANCA Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever you had it, I'll take out no work on't. CASSIO How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now! OTHELLO By heaven, that should be my handkerchief! BIANCA An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you will not, come when you are next prepared for. Exit  IAGO After her, after her. CASSIO 'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else. IAGO Will you sup there? CASSIO 'Faith, I intend so. IAGO Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain speak with you. CASSIO Prithee, come; will you? IAGO Go to; say no more. Exit CASSIO  OTHELLO [Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago? IAGO Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice? OTHELLO O Iago! IAGO And did you see the handkerchief? OTHELLO Was that mine? IAGO Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore. OTHELLO I would have him nine years a-killing. A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman! IAGO Nay, you must forget that. OTHELLO Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks. IAGO Nay, that's not your way. OTHELLO Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high and plenteous wit and invention:-- IAGO She's the worse for all this. OTHELLO O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so gentle a condition! IAGO Ay, too gentle. OTHELLO Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago! O Iago, the pity of it, Iago! IAGO If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody. OTHELLO I will chop her into messes: cuckold me! IAGO O, 'tis foul in her. OTHELLO With mine officer! IAGO That's fouler. OTHELLO Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago. IAGO Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated. OTHELLO Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good. IAGO And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you shall hear more by midnight. OTHELLO Excellent good. A trumpet within  What trumpet is that same? IAGO Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him. Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants  LODOVICO Save you, worthy general! OTHELLO With all my heart, sir. LODOVICO The duke and senators of Venice greet you. Gives him a letter  OTHELLO I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. Opens the letter, and reads  DESDEMONA And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? IAGO I am very glad to see you, signior Welcome to Cyprus. LODOVICO I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio? IAGO Lives, sir. DESDEMONA Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord An unkind breach: but you shall make all well. OTHELLO Are you sure of that? DESDEMONA My lord? OTHELLO [Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--' LODOVICO He did not call; he's busy in the paper. Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio? DESDEMONA A most unhappy one: I would do much To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio. OTHELLO Fire and brimstone! DESDEMONA My lord? OTHELLO Are you wise? DESDEMONA What, is he angry? LODOVICO May be the letter moved him; For, as I think, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his government. DESDEMONA Trust me, I am glad on't. OTHELLO Indeed! DESDEMONA My lord? OTHELLO I am glad to see you mad. DESDEMONA Why, sweet Othello,-- OTHELLO [Striking her] Devil! DESDEMONA I have not deserved this. LODOVICO My lord, this would not be believed in Venice, Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much: Make her amends; she weeps. OTHELLO O devil, devil! If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile. Out of my sight! DESDEMONA I will not stay to offend you. Going  LODOVICO Truly, an obedient lady: I do beseech your lordship, call her back. OTHELLO Mistress! DESDEMONA My lord? OTHELLO What would you with her, sir? LODOVICO Who, I, my lord? OTHELLO Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn: Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on, And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep; And she's obedient, as you say, obedient, Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears. Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!-- I am commanded home. Get you away; I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt! Exit DESDEMONA  Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together: You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys! Exit  LODOVICO Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue The shot of accident, nor dart of chance, Could neither graze nor pierce? IAGO He is much changed. LODOVICO Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain? IAGO He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure What he might be: if what he might he is not, I would to heaven he were! LODOVICO What, strike his wife! IAGO 'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst! LODOVICO Is it his use? Or did the letters work upon his blood, And new-create this fault? IAGO Alas, alas! It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known. You shall observe him, And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech: do but go after, And mark how he continues. LODOVICO I am sorry that I am deceived in him. Exeunt  SCENE II. A room in the castle. Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA OTHELLO You have seen nothing then? EMILIA Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect. OTHELLO Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together. EMILIA But then I saw no harm, and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them. OTHELLO What, did they never whisper? EMILIA Never, my lord. OTHELLO Nor send you out o' the way? EMILIA Never. OTHELLO To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing? EMILIA Never, my lord. OTHELLO That's strange. EMILIA I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest, Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other, Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom. If any wretch have put this in your head, Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true, There's no man happy; the purest of their wives Is foul as slander. OTHELLO Bid her come hither: go. Exit EMILIA  She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore, A closet lock and key of villanous secrets And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't. Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA  DESDEMONA My lord, what is your will? OTHELLO Pray, chuck, come hither. DESDEMONA What is your pleasure? OTHELLO Let me see your eyes; Look in my face. DESDEMONA What horrible fancy's this? OTHELLO [To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress; Leave procreants alone and shut the door; Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come: Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch. Exit EMILIA  DESDEMONA Upon my knees, what doth your speech import? I understand a fury in your words. But not the words. OTHELLO Why, what art thou? DESDEMONA Your wife, my lord; your true And loyal wife. OTHELLO Come, swear it, damn thyself Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd: Swear thou art honest. DESDEMONA Heaven doth truly know it. OTHELLO Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell. DESDEMONA To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false? OTHELLO O Desdemona! away! away! away! DESDEMONA Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep? Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? If haply you my father do suspect An instrument of this your calling back, Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him, Why, I have lost him too. OTHELLO Had it pleased heaven To try me with affliction; had they rain'd All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head. Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips, Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes, I should have found in some place of my soul A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me A fixed figure for the time of scorn To point his slow unmoving finger at! Yet could I bear that too; well, very well: But there, where I have garner'd up my heart, Where either I must live, or bear no life; The fountain from the which my current runs, Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there, Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,-- Ay, there, look grim as hell! DESDEMONA I hope my noble lord esteems me honest. OTHELLO O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles, That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed, Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born! DESDEMONA Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed? OTHELLO Was this fair paper, this most goodly book, Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed! Committed! O thou public commoner! I should make very forges of my cheeks, That would to cinders burn up modesty, Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed! Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks, The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth, And will not hear it. What committed! Impudent strumpet! DESDEMONA By heaven, you do me wrong. OTHELLO Are you not a strumpet? DESDEMONA No, as I am a Christian: If to preserve this vessel for my lord From any other foul unlawful touch Be not to be a strumpet, I am none. OTHELLO What, not a whore? DESDEMONA No, as I shall be saved. OTHELLO Is't possible? DESDEMONA O, heaven forgive us! OTHELLO I cry you mercy, then: I took you for that cunning whore of Venice That married with Othello. Raising his voice  You, mistress, That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, And keep the gate of hell! Re-enter EMILIA  You, you, ay, you! We have done our course; there's money for your pains: I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel. Exit  EMILIA Alas, what does this gentleman conceive? How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady? DESDEMONA 'Faith, half asleep. EMILIA Good madam, what's the matter with my lord? DESDEMONA With who? EMILIA Why, with my lord, madam. DESDEMONA Who is thy lord? EMILIA He that is yours, sweet lady. DESDEMONA I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia; I cannot weep; nor answer have I none, But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember; And call thy husband hither. EMILIA Here's a change indeed! Exit  DESDEMONA 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet. How have I been behaved, that he might stick The small'st opinion on my least misuse? Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO  IAGO What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you? DESDEMONA I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes Do it with gentle means and easy tasks: He might have chid me so; for, in good faith, I am a child to chiding. IAGO What's the matter, lady? EMILIA Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her. Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her, As true hearts cannot bear. DESDEMONA Am I that name, Iago? IAGO What name, fair lady? DESDEMONA Such as she says my lord did say I was. EMILIA He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink Could not have laid such terms upon his callat. IAGO Why did he so? DESDEMONA I do not know; I am sure I am none such. IAGO Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! EMILIA Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country and her friends, To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep? DESDEMONA It is my wretched fortune. IAGO Beshrew him for't! How comes this trick upon him? DESDEMONA Nay, heaven doth know. EMILIA I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain, Some busy and insinuating rogue, Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office, Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else. IAGO Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible. DESDEMONA If any such there be, heaven pardon him! EMILIA A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones! Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company? What place? what time? what form? what likelihood? The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave, Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow. O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold, And put in every honest hand a whip To lash the rascals naked through the world Even from the east to the west! IAGO Speak within door. EMILIA O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moor. IAGO You are a fool; go to. DESDEMONA O good Iago, What shall I do to win my lord again? Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven, I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel: If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love, Either in discourse of thought or actual deed, Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense, Delighted them in any other form; Or that I do not yet, and ever did. And ever will--though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly, Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much; And his unkindness may defeat my life, But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:' It does abhor me now I speak the word; To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. IAGO I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour: The business of the state does him offence, And he does chide with you. DESDEMONA If 'twere no other-- IAGO 'Tis but so, I warrant. Trumpets within  Hark, how these instruments summon to supper! The messengers of Venice stay the meat; Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well. Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA  Enter RODERIGO  How now, Roderigo! RODERIGO I do not find that thou dealest justly with me. IAGO What in the contrary? RODERIGO Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered. IAGO Will you hear me, Roderigo? RODERIGO 'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together. IAGO You charge me most unjustly. RODERIGO With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist: you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none. IAGO Well; go to; very well. RODERIGO Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fobbed in it. IAGO Very well. RODERIGO I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona: if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you. IAGO You have said now. RODERIGO Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing. IAGO Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair. RODERIGO It hath not appeared. IAGO I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life. RODERIGO Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass? IAGO Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place. RODERIGO Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice. IAGO O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio. RODERIGO How do you mean, removing of him? IAGO Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place; knocking out his brains. RODERIGO And that you would have me to do? IAGO Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste: about it. RODERIGO I will hear further reason for this. IAGO And you shall be satisfied. Exeunt  SCENE III. Another room In the castle. Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants LODOVICO I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further. OTHELLO O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk. LODOVICO Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship. DESDEMONA Your honour is most welcome. OTHELLO Will you walk, sir? O,--Desdemona,-- DESDEMONA My lord? OTHELLO Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done. DESDEMONA I will, my lord. Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants  EMILIA How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did. DESDEMONA He says he will return incontinent: He hath commanded me to go to bed, And bade me to dismiss you. EMILIA Dismiss me! DESDEMONA It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,. Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu: We must not now displease him. EMILIA I would you had never seen him! DESDEMONA So would not I my love doth so approve him, That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns-- Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them. EMILIA I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. DESDEMONA All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds! If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me In one of those same sheets. EMILIA Come, come you talk. DESDEMONA My mother had a maid call'd Barbara: She was in love, and he she loved proved mad And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;' An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune, And she died singing it: that song to-night Will not go from my mind; I have much to do, But to go hang my head all at one side, And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch. EMILIA Shall I go fetch your night-gown? DESDEMONA No, unpin me here. This Lodovico is a proper man. EMILIA A very handsome man. DESDEMONA He speaks well. EMILIA I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip. DESDEMONA [Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, Sing all a green willow: Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee, Sing willow, willow, willow: The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans; Sing willow, willow, willow; Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones; Lay by these:-- Singing  Sing willow, willow, willow; Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:-- Singing  Sing all a green willow must be my garland. Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,- Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks? EMILIA It's the wind. DESDEMONA [Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what said he then? Sing willow, willow, willow: If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men! So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch; Doth that bode weeping? EMILIA 'Tis neither here nor there. DESDEMONA I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men! Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,-- That there be women do abuse their husbands In such gross kind? EMILIA There be some such, no question. DESDEMONA Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? EMILIA Why, would not you? DESDEMONA No, by this heavenly light! EMILIA Nor I neither by this heavenly light; I might do't as well i' the dark. DESDEMONA Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? EMILIA The world's a huge thing: it is a great price. For a small vice. DESDEMONA In troth, I think thou wouldst not. EMILIA In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for't. DESDEMONA Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world. EMILIA Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right. DESDEMONA I do not think there is any such woman. EMILIA Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for. But I do think it is their husbands' faults If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties, And pour our treasures into foreign laps, Or else break out in peevish jealousies, Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us, Or scant our former having in despite; Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace, Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell And have their palates both for sweet and sour, As husbands have. What is it that they do When they change us for others? Is it sport? I think it is: and doth affection breed it? I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs? It is so too: and have not we affections, Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have? Then let them use us well: else let them know, The ills we do, their ills instruct us so. DESDEMONA Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send, Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend! Exeunt  ACT V SCENE I. Cyprus. A street. Enter IAGO and RODERIGO IAGO Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come: Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home: Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow: It makes us, or it mars us; think on that, And fix most firm thy resolution. RODERIGO Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't. IAGO Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand. Retires  RODERIGO I have no great devotion to the deed; And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons: 'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies. IAGO I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense, And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio, Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo, He calls me to a restitution large Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him, As gifts to Desdemona; It must not be: if Cassio do remain, He hath a daily beauty in his life That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril: No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming. Enter CASSIO  RODERIGO I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest! Makes a pass at CASSIO  CASSIO That thrust had been mine enemy indeed, But that my coat is better than thou know'st I will make proof of thine. Draws, and wounds RODERIGO  RODERIGO O, I am slain! IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit  CASSIO I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder! Falls  Enter OTHELLO  OTHELLO The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word. RODERIGO O, villain that I am! OTHELLO It is even so. CASSIO O, help, ho! light! a surgeon! OTHELLO 'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just, That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong! Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead, And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come. Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted; Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted. Exit  Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO  CASSIO What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder! GRATIANO 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful. CASSIO O, help! LODOVICO Hark! RODERIGO O wretched villain! LODOVICO Two or three groan: it is a heavy night: These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe To come in to the cry without more help. RODERIGO Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death. LODOVICO Hark! Re-enter IAGO, with a light  GRATIANO Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons. IAGO Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder? LODOVICO We do not know. IAGO Did not you hear a cry? CASSIO Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me! IAGO What's the matter? GRATIANO This is Othello's ancient, as I take it. LODOVICO The same indeed; a very valiant fellow. IAGO What are you here that cry so grievously? CASSIO Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains! Give me some help. IAGO O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this? CASSIO I think that one of them is hereabout, And cannot make away. IAGO O treacherous villains! What are you there? come in, and give some help. To LODOVICO and GRATIANO  RODERIGO O, help me here! CASSIO That's one of them. IAGO O murderous slave! O villain! Stabs RODERIGO  RODERIGO O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog! IAGO Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?-- How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!-- What may you be? are you of good or evil? LODOVICO As you shall prove us, praise us. IAGO Signior Lodovico? LODOVICO He, sir. IAGO I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains. GRATIANO Cassio! IAGO How is't, brother! CASSIO My leg is cut in two. IAGO Marry, heaven forbid! Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt. Enter BIANCA  BIANCA What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried? IAGO Who is't that cried! BIANCA O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! IAGO O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be that have thus many led you? CASSIO No. GRATIANO I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you. IAGO Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair, To bear him easily hence! BIANCA Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio! IAGO Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash To be a party in this injury. Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come; Lend me a light. Know we this face or no? Alas my friend and my dear countryman Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo. GRATIANO What, of Venice? IAGO Even he, sir; did you know him? GRATIANO Know him! ay. IAGO Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon; These bloody accidents must excuse my manners, That so neglected you. GRATIANO I am glad to see you. IAGO How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair! GRATIANO Roderigo! IAGO He, he 'tis he. A chair brought in  O, that's well said; the chair! GRATIANO Some good man bear him carefully from hence; I'll fetch the general's surgeon. To BIANCA  For you, mistress, Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio, Was my dear friend: what malice was between you? CASSIO None in the world; nor do I know the man. IAGO [To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air. CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off  Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress? Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon. Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her: Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak, Though tongues were out of use. Enter EMILIA  EMILIA 'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband? IAGO Cassio hath here been set on in the dark By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped: He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead. EMILIA Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio! IAGO This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia, Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night. To BIANCA  What, do you shake at that? BIANCA He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not. IAGO O, did he so? I charge you, go with me. EMILIA Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet! BIANCA I am no strumpet; but of life as honest As you that thus abuse me. EMILIA As I! foh! fie upon thee! IAGO Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd. Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale. Emilia run you to the citadel, And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd. Will you go on? I pray. Aside  This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite. Exeunt  SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep; a light burning. Enter OTHELLO  OTHELLO It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,-- Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!-- It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood; Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow, And smooth as monumental alabaster. Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men. Put out the light, and then put out the light: If I quench thee, thou flaming minister, I can again thy former light restore, Should I repent me: but once put out thy light, Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature, I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, I cannot give it vital growth again. It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree. Kissing her  Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword! One more, one more. Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, And love thee after. One more, and this the last: So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep, But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly; It strikes where it doth love. She wakes. DESDEMONA Who's there? Othello? OTHELLO Ay. Desdemona. DESDEMONA Will you come to bed, my lord? OTHELLO Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona? DESDEMONA Ay, my lord. OTHELLO If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace, Solicit for it straight. DESDEMONA Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that? OTHELLO Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by: I would not kill thy unprepared spirit; No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul. DESDEMONA Talk you of killing? OTHELLO Ay, I do. DESDEMONA Then heaven Have mercy on me! OTHELLO Amen, with all my heart! DESDEMONA If you say so, I hope you will not kill me. OTHELLO Hum! DESDEMONA And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear. OTHELLO Think on thy sins. DESDEMONA They are loves I bear to you. OTHELLO Ay, and for that thou diest. DESDEMONA That death's unnatural that kills for loving. Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip? Some bloody passion shakes your very frame: These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope, They do not point on me. OTHELLO Peace, and be still! DESDEMONA I will so. What's the matter? OTHELLO That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou gavest to Cassio. DESDEMONA No, by my life and soul! Send for the man, and ask him. OTHELLO Sweet soul, take heed, Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed. DESDEMONA Ay, but not yet to die. OTHELLO Yes, presently: Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin; For to deny each article with oath Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal. Thou art to die. DESDEMONA Then Lord have mercy on me! OTHELLO I say, amen. DESDEMONA And have you mercy too! I never did Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love: I never gave him token. OTHELLO By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand. O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart, And makest me call what I intend to do A murder, which I thought a sacrifice: I saw the handkerchief. DESDEMONA He found it then; I never gave it him: send for him hither; Let him confess a truth. OTHELLO He hath confess'd. DESDEMONA What, my lord? OTHELLO That he hath used thee. DESDEMONA How? unlawfully? OTHELLO Ay. DESDEMONA He will not say so. OTHELLO No, his mouth is stopp'd; Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't. DESDEMONA O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead? OTHELLO Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge Had stomach for them all. DESDEMONA Alas! he is betray'd and I undone. OTHELLO Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face? DESDEMONA O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not! OTHELLO Down, strumpet! DESDEMONA Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night! OTHELLO Nay, if you strive-- DESDEMONA But half an hour! OTHELLO Being done, there is no pause. DESDEMONA But while I say one prayer! OTHELLO It is too late. He stifles her  EMILIA [Within] My lord , my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord! OTHELLO What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead? I that am cruel am yet merciful; I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so. EMILIA [Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord! OTHELLO Who's there? EMILIA [Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you! OTHELLO Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead. 'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.-- The noise was here. Ha! no more moving? Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?-- I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do? If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife: My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife. O insupportable! O heavy hour! Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration. EMILIA [Within] I do beseech you That I may speak with you, O, good my lord! OTHELLO I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia; Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw. Where art thou? Unlocks the door  Enter EMILIA  What's the matter with thee now? EMILIA O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done! OTHELLO What, now? EMILIA But now, my lord. OTHELLO It is the very error of the moon; She comes more nearer earth than she was wont, And makes men mad. EMILIA Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian Call'd Roderigo. OTHELLO Roderigo kill'd! And Cassio kill'd! EMILIA No, Cassio is not kill'd. OTHELLO Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune, And sweet revenge grows harsh. DESDEMONA O, falsely, falsely murder'd! EMILIA Alas, what cry is that? OTHELLO That! what? EMILIA Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice. Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again! Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak! DESDEMONA A guiltless death I die. EMILIA O, who hath done this deed? DESDEMONA Nobody; I myself. Farewell Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell! Dies  OTHELLO Why, how should she be murder'd? EMILIA Alas, who knows? OTHELLO You heard her say herself, it was not I. EMILIA She said so: I must needs report the truth. OTHELLO She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell: 'Twas I that kill'd her. EMILIA O, the more angel she, And you the blacker devil! OTHELLO She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore. EMILIA Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil. OTHELLO She was false as water. EMILIA Thou art rash as fire, to say That she was false: O, she was heavenly true! OTHELLO Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else. O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell, But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all. EMILIA My husband! OTHELLO Thy husband. EMILIA That she was false to wedlock? OTHELLO Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true, If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite, I'ld not have sold her for it. EMILIA My husband! OTHELLO Ay, 'twas he that told me first: An honest man he is, and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds. EMILIA My husband! OTHELLO What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband. EMILIA O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love, My husband say that she was false! OTHELLO He, woman; I say thy husband: dost understand the word? My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago. EMILIA If he say so, may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart: She was too fond of her most filthy bargain. OTHELLO Ha! EMILIA Do thy worst: This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her. OTHELLO Peace, you were best. EMILIA Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt! As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed-- I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known, Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help! The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder! Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others  MONTANO What is the matter? How now, general! EMILIA O, are you come, Iago? you have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck. GRATIANO What is the matter? EMILIA Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man: He says thou told'st him that his wife was false: I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain: Speak, for my heart is full. IAGO I told him what I thought, and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true. EMILIA But did you ever tell him she was false? IAGO I did. EMILIA You told a lie, an odious, damned lie; Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie. She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio? IAGO With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue. EMILIA I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak: My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,-- All O heavens forfend! EMILIA And your reports have set the murder on. OTHELLO Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed. GRATIANO 'Tis a strange truth. MONTANO O monstrous act! EMILIA Villany, villany, villany! I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!-- I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:-- O villany, villany! IAGO What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home. EMILIA Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak: 'Tis proper I obey him, but not now. Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home. OTHELLO O! O! O! He falls on the bed  EMILIA Nay, lay thee down and roar; For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye. OTHELLO [Rising] O, she was foul! I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece, Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd: I know this act shows horrible and grim. GRATIANO Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead: Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now, This sight would make him do a desperate turn, Yea, curse his better angel from his side, And fall to reprobation. OTHELLO 'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it: And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand: It was a handkerchief, an antique token My father gave my mother. EMILIA O heaven! O heavenly powers! IAGO Come, hold your peace. EMILIA 'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace! No, I will speak as liberal as the north: Let heaven and men and devils, let them all, All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak. IAGO Be wise, and get you home. EMILIA I will not. IAGO offers to stab EMILIA  GRATIANO Fie! Your sword upon a woman? EMILIA O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband; For often, with a solemn earnestness, More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle, He begg'd of me to steal it. IAGO Villanous whore! EMILIA She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it, And I did give't my husband. IAGO Filth, thou liest! EMILIA By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen. O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool Do with so good a woman? OTHELLO Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain! He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit  GRATIANO The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife. EMILIA Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side. GRATIANO He's gone, but his wife's kill'd. MONTANO 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon, Which I have here recover'd from the Moor: Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain, For 'tis a damned slave. Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO  OTHELLO I am not valiant neither, But ever puny whipster gets my sword: But why should honour outlive honesty? Let it go all. EMILIA What did thy song bode, lady? Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan. And die in music. Singing  Willow, willow, willow,-- Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor; So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true; So speaking as I think, I die, I die. Dies  OTHELLO I have another weapon in this chamber; It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:-- O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth. GRATIANO [Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear: Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer. OTHELLO Look in upon me then and speak with me, Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee. Re-enter GRATIANO  GRATIANO What is the matter? OTHELLO Behold, I have a weapon; A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day, That, with this little arm and this good sword, I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast! Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now. Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd; Here is my journey's end, here is my butt, And very sea-mark of my utmost sail. Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear; Man but a rush against Othello's breast, And he retires. Where should Othello go? Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench! Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt, This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven, And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl! Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave! Whip me, ye devils, From the possession of this heavenly sight! Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur! Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire! O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead! Oh! Oh! Oh! Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner  LODOVICO Where is this rash and most unfortunate man? OTHELLO That's he that was Othello: here I am. LODOVICO Where is that viper? bring the villain forth. OTHELLO I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable. If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee. Wounds IAGO  LODOVICO Wrench his sword from him. IAGO I bleed, sir; but not kill'd. OTHELLO I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live; For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die. LODOVICO O thou Othello, thou wert once so good, Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave, What shall be said to thee? OTHELLO Why, any thing: An honourable murderer, if you will; For nought I did in hate, but all in honour. LODOVICO This wretch hath part confess'd his villany: Did you and he consent in Cassio's death? OTHELLO Ay. CASSIO Dear general, I never gave you cause. OTHELLO I do believe it, and I ask your pardon. Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body? IAGO Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: From this time forth I never will speak word. LODOVICO What, not to pray? GRATIANO Torments will ope your lips. OTHELLO Well, thou dost best. LODOVICO Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n, Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo; And here another: the one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo. OTHELLO O villain! CASSIO Most heathenish and most gross! LODOVICO Now here's another discontented paper, Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems, Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain; But that belike Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him. OTHELLO O the pernicious caitiff! How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief That was my wife's? CASSIO I found it in my chamber: And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire. OTHELLO O fool! fool! fool! CASSIO There is besides in Roderigo's letter, How he upbraids Iago, that he made him Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came That I was cast: and even but now he spake, After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him, Iago set him on. LODOVICO You must forsake this room, and go with us: Your power and your command is taken off, And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave, If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long, It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest, Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away. OTHELLO Soft you; a word or two before you go. I have done the state some service, and they know't. No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well; Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes, Albeit unused to the melting mood, Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum. Set you down this; And say besides, that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcised dog, And smote him, thus. Stabs himself  LODOVICO O bloody period! GRATIANO All that's spoke is marr'd. OTHELLO I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this; Killing myself, to die upon a kiss. Falls on the bed, and dies  CASSIO This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon; For he was great of heart. LODOVICO [To IAGO] O Spartan dog, More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea! Look on the tragic loading of this bed; This is thy work: the object poisons sight; Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house, And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor, Remains the censure of this hellish villain; The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it! Myself will straight aboard: and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate. Exeunt  The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark ACT I SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle. FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO BERNARDO Who's there? FRANCISCO Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself. BERNARDO Long live the king! FRANCISCO Bernardo? BERNARDO He. FRANCISCO You come most carefully upon your hour. BERNARDO 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco. FRANCISCO For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart. BERNARDO Have you had quiet guard? FRANCISCO Not a mouse stirring. BERNARDO Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. FRANCISCO I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there? Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS  HORATIO Friends to this ground. MARCELLUS And liegemen to the Dane. FRANCISCO Give you good night. MARCELLUS O, farewell, honest soldier: Who hath relieved you? FRANCISCO Bernardo has my place. Give you good night. Exit  MARCELLUS Holla! Bernardo! BERNARDO Say, What, is Horatio there? HORATIO A piece of him. BERNARDO Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus. MARCELLUS What, has this thing appear'd again to-night? BERNARDO I have seen nothing. MARCELLUS Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us: Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night; That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it. HORATIO Tush, tush, 'twill not appear. BERNARDO Sit down awhile; And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story What we have two nights seen. HORATIO Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this. BERNARDO Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one,-- Enter Ghost  MARCELLUS Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again! BERNARDO In the same figure, like the king that's dead. MARCELLUS Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio. BERNARDO Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio. HORATIO Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder. BERNARDO It would be spoke to. MARCELLUS Question it, Horatio. HORATIO What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak! MARCELLUS It is offended. BERNARDO See, it stalks away! HORATIO Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak! Exit Ghost  MARCELLUS 'Tis gone, and will not answer. BERNARDO How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on't? HORATIO Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes. MARCELLUS Is it not like the king? HORATIO As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated; So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange. MARCELLUS Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not; But in the gross and scope of my opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state. MARCELLUS Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is't that can inform me? HORATIO That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appear'd to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet-- For so this side of our known world esteem'd him-- Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had return'd To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, And carriage of the article design'd, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other-- As it doth well appear unto our state-- But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this post-haste and romage in the land. BERNARDO I think it be no other but e'en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch; so like the king That was and is the question of these wars. HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: And even the like precurse of fierce events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on, Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen.-- But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! Re-enter Ghost  I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me: Cock crows  If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus. MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan? HORATIO Do, if it will not stand. BERNARDO 'Tis here! HORATIO 'Tis here! MARCELLUS 'Tis gone! Exit Ghost  We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery. BERNARDO It was about to speak, when the cock crew. HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine: and of the truth herein This present object made probation. MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long: And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it. But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill: Break we our watch up; and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? MARCELLUS Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt  SCENE II. A room of state in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants KING CLAUDIUS Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,-- With an auspicious and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole,-- Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, He hath not fail'd to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,-- Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king, more than the scope Of these delated articles allow. Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty. CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND In that and all things will we show our duty. KING CLAUDIUS We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS  And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes? LAERTES My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. KING CLAUDIUS Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? LORD POLONIUS He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent: I do beseech you, give him leave to go. KING CLAUDIUS Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,-- HAMLET [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind. KING CLAUDIUS How is it that the clouds still hang on you? HAMLET Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun. QUEEN GERTRUDE Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity. HAMLET Ay, madam, it is common. QUEEN GERTRUDE If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee? HAMLET Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play: But I have that within which passeth show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe. KING CLAUDIUS 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschool'd: For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd: whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son. QUEEN GERTRUDE Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg. HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you, madam. KING CLAUDIUS Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again, Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. Exeunt all but HAMLET  HAMLET O, that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: and yet, within a month-- Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!-- A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she follow'd my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she-- O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules: within a month: Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not nor it cannot come to good: But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue. Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO  HORATIO Hail to your lordship! HAMLET I am glad to see you well: Horatio,--or I do forget myself. HORATIO The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. HAMLET Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus? MARCELLUS My good lord-- HAMLET I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg? HORATIO A truant disposition, good my lord. HAMLET I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself: I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. HORATIO My lord, I came to see your father's funeral. HAMLET I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student; I think it was to see my mother's wedding. HORATIO Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon. HAMLET Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! My father!--methinks I see my father. HORATIO Where, my lord? HAMLET In my mind's eye, Horatio. HORATIO I saw him once; he was a goodly king. HAMLET He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again. HORATIO My lord, I think I saw him yesternight. HAMLET Saw? who? HORATIO My lord, the king your father. HAMLET The king my father! HORATIO Season your admiration for awhile With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you. HAMLET For God's love, let me hear. HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead vast and middle of the night, Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did; And I with them the third night kept the watch; Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes: I knew your father; These hands are not more like. HAMLET But where was this? MARCELLUS My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. HAMLET Did you not speak to it? HORATIO My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up its head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanish'd from our sight. HAMLET 'Tis very strange. HORATIO As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it. HAMLET Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night? MARCELLUS BERNARDO We do, my lord. HAMLET Arm'd, say you? MARCELLUS BERNARDO Arm'd, my lord. HAMLET From top to toe? MARCELLUS BERNARDO My lord, from head to foot. HAMLET Then saw you not his face? HORATIO O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up. HAMLET What, look'd he frowningly? HORATIO A countenance more in sorrow than in anger. HAMLET Pale or red? HORATIO Nay, very pale. HAMLET And fix'd his eyes upon you? HORATIO Most constantly. HAMLET I would I had been there. HORATIO It would have much amazed you. HAMLET Very like, very like. Stay'd it long? HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred. MARCELLUS BERNARDO Longer, longer. HORATIO Not when I saw't. HAMLET His beard was grizzled--no? HORATIO It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd. HAMLET I will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again. HORATIO I warrant it will. HAMLET If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you. All Our duty to your honour. HAMLET Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. Exeunt all but HAMLET  My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. Exit  SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house. Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA LAERTES My necessaries are embark'd: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you. OPHELIA Do you doubt that? LAERTES For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more. OPHELIA No more but so? LAERTES Think it no more; For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will: but you must fear, His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmaster'd importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring, Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near. OPHELIA I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede. LAERTES O, fear me not. I stay too long: but here my father comes. Enter POLONIUS  A double blessing is a double grace, Occasion smiles upon a second leave. LORD POLONIUS Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine ownself be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee! LAERTES Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord. LORD POLONIUS The time invites you; go; your servants tend. LAERTES Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What I have said to you. OPHELIA 'Tis in my memory lock'd, And you yourself shall keep the key of it. LAERTES Farewell. Exit  LORD POLONIUS What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you? OPHELIA So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. LORD POLONIUS Marry, well bethought: 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: If it be so, as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution, I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth. OPHELIA He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me. LORD POLONIUS Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them? OPHELIA I do not know, my lord, what I should think. LORD POLONIUS Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby; That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool. OPHELIA My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion. LORD POLONIUS Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to. OPHELIA And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven. LORD POLONIUS Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you: come your ways. OPHELIA I shall obey, my lord. Exeunt  SCENE IV. The platform. Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS HAMLET The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air. HAMLET What hour now? HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve. HAMLET No, it is struck. HORATIO Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within  What does this mean, my lord? HAMLET The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge. HORATIO Is it a custom? HAMLET Ay, marry, is't: But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honour'd in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though perform'd at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin-- By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens The form of plausive manners, that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,-- Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo-- Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault: the dram of eale Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal. HORATIO Look, my lord, it comes! Enter Ghost  HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? Ghost beckons HAMLET  HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone. MARCELLUS Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground: But do not go with it. HORATIO No, by no means. HAMLET It will not speak; then I will follow it. HORATIO Do not, my lord. HAMLET Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life in a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again: I'll follow it. HORATIO What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? think of it: The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath. HAMLET It waves me still. Go on; I'll follow thee. MARCELLUS You shall not go, my lord. HAMLET Hold off your hands. HORATIO Be ruled; you shall not go. HAMLET My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee. Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET  HORATIO He waxes desperate with imagination. MARCELLUS Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him. HORATIO Have after. To what issue will this come? MARCELLUS Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. HORATIO Heaven will direct it. MARCELLUS Nay, let's follow him. Exeunt  SCENE V. Another part of the platform. Enter GHOST and HAMLET HAMLET Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further. Ghost Mark me. HAMLET I will. Ghost My hour is almost come, When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself. HAMLET Alas, poor ghost! Ghost Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold. HAMLET Speak; I am bound to hear. Ghost So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear. HAMLET What? Ghost I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love-- HAMLET O God! Ghost Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. HAMLET Murder! Ghost Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange and unnatural. HAMLET Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge. Ghost I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown. HAMLET O my prophetic soul! My uncle! Ghost Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,-- O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen: O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd, Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd: Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head: O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire: Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me. Exit  HAMLET O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else? And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables,--meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark: Writing  So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.' I have sworn 't. MARCELLUS HORATIO [Within] My lord, my lord,-- MARCELLUS [Within] Lord Hamlet,-- HORATIO [Within] Heaven secure him! HAMLET So be it! HORATIO [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord! HAMLET Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS  MARCELLUS How is't, my noble lord? HORATIO What news, my lord? HAMLET O, wonderful! HORATIO Good my lord, tell it. HAMLET No; you'll reveal it. HORATIO Not I, my lord, by heaven. MARCELLUS Nor I, my lord. HAMLET How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? But you'll be secret? HORATIO MARCELLUS Ay, by heaven, my lord. HAMLET There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave. HORATIO There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this. HAMLET Why, right; you are i' the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You, as your business and desire shall point you; For every man has business and desire, Such as it is; and for mine own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray. HORATIO These are but wild and whirling words, my lord. HAMLET I'm sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, 'faith heartily. HORATIO There's no offence, my lord. HAMLET Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: For your desire to know what is between us, O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request. HORATIO What is't, my lord? we will. HAMLET Never make known what you have seen to-night. HORATIO MARCELLUS My lord, we will not. HAMLET Nay, but swear't. HORATIO In faith, My lord, not I. MARCELLUS Nor I, my lord, in faith. HAMLET Upon my sword. MARCELLUS We have sworn, my lord, already. HAMLET Indeed, upon my sword, indeed. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. HAMLET Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage-- Consent to swear. HORATIO Propose the oath, my lord. HAMLET Never to speak of this that you have seen, Swear by my sword. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. HAMLET Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword: Never to speak of this that you have heard, Swear by my sword. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. HAMLET Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends. HORATIO O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! HAMLET And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on, That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,' Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,' Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me: this not to do, So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear. Ghost [Beneath] Swear. HAMLET Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! They swear  So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together. Exeunt  ACT II SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house. Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO LORD POLONIUS Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo. REYNALDO I will, my lord. LORD POLONIUS You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior. REYNALDO My lord, I did intend it. LORD POLONIUS Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it: Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo? REYNALDO Ay, very well, my lord. LORD POLONIUS 'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well: But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild; Addicted so and so:' and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty. REYNALDO As gaming, my lord. LORD POLONIUS Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing: you may go so far. REYNALDO My lord, that would dishonour him. LORD POLONIUS 'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault. REYNALDO But, my good lord,-- LORD POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this? REYNALDO Ay, my lord, I would know that. LORD POLONIUS Marry, sir, here's my drift; And I believe, it is a fetch of wit: You laying these slight sullies on my son, As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured He closes with you in this consequence; 'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,' According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country. REYNALDO Very good, my lord. LORD POLONIUS And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something: where did I leave? REYNALDO At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and 'gentleman.' LORD POLONIUS At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry; He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman; I saw him yesterday, or t' other day, Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; There falling out at tennis:' or perchance, 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,' Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out: So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not? REYNALDO My lord, I have. LORD POLONIUS God be wi' you; fare you well. REYNALDO Good my lord! LORD POLONIUS Observe his inclination in yourself. REYNALDO I shall, my lord. LORD POLONIUS And let him ply his music. REYNALDO Well, my lord. LORD POLONIUS Farewell! Exit REYNALDO  Enter OPHELIA  How now, Ophelia! what's the matter? OPHELIA O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted! LORD POLONIUS With what, i' the name of God? OPHELIA My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd, Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors,--he comes before me. LORD POLONIUS Mad for thy love? OPHELIA My lord, I do not know; But truly, I do fear it. LORD POLONIUS What said he? OPHELIA He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being: that done, he lets me go: And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd, He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; For out o' doors he went without their helps, And, to the last, bended their light on me. LORD POLONIUS Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late? OPHELIA No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did repel his fetters and denied His access to me. LORD POLONIUS That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle, And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Exeunt  SCENE II. A room in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants KING CLAUDIUS Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it, Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, That, being of so young days brought up with him, And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time: so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, That, open'd, lies within our remedy. QUEEN GERTRUDE Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you; And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance. ROSENCRANTZ Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty. GUILDENSTERN But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded. KING CLAUDIUS Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern. QUEEN GERTRUDE Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is. GUILDENSTERN Heavens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpful to him! QUEEN GERTRUDE Ay, amen! Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants  Enter POLONIUS  LORD POLONIUS The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully return'd. KING CLAUDIUS Thou still hast been the father of good news. LORD POLONIUS Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king: And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy. KING CLAUDIUS O, speak of that; that do I long to hear. LORD POLONIUS Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast. KING CLAUDIUS Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. Exit POLONIUS  He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper. QUEEN GERTRUDE I doubt it is no other but the main; His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage. KING CLAUDIUS Well, we shall sift him. Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS  Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway? VOLTIMAND Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; But, better look'd into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat grieved, That so his sickness, age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, Giving a paper  That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down. KING CLAUDIUS It likes us well; And at our more consider'd time well read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour: Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together: Most welcome home! Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS  LORD POLONIUS This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad: Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go. QUEEN GERTRUDE More matter, with less art. LORD POLONIUS Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause: Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughter--have while she is mine-- Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise. Reads  'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,'-- That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: Reads  'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.' QUEEN GERTRUDE Came this from Hamlet to her? LORD POLONIUS Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. Reads  'Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move; Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love. 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu. 'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, HAMLET.' This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means and place, All given to mine ear. KING CLAUDIUS But how hath she Received his love? LORD POLONIUS What do you think of me? KING CLAUDIUS As of a man faithful and honourable. LORD POLONIUS I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing-- As I perceived it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me--what might you, Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, If I had play'd the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or look'd upon this love with idle sight; What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he, repulsed--a short tale to make-- Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for. KING CLAUDIUS Do you think 'tis this? QUEEN GERTRUDE It may be, very likely. LORD POLONIUS Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that-- That I have positively said 'Tis so,' When it proved otherwise? KING CLAUDIUS Not that I know. LORD POLONIUS [Pointing to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this be otherwise: If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre. KING CLAUDIUS How may we try it further? LORD POLONIUS You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby. QUEEN GERTRUDE So he does indeed. LORD POLONIUS At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter: if he love her not And be not from his reason fall'n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters. KING CLAUDIUS We will try it. QUEEN GERTRUDE But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading. LORD POLONIUS Away, I do beseech you, both away: I'll board him presently. Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants  Enter HAMLET, reading  O, give me leave: How does my good Lord Hamlet? HAMLET Well, God-a-mercy. LORD POLONIUS Do you know me, my lord? HAMLET Excellent well; you are a fishmonger. LORD POLONIUS Not I, my lord. HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man. LORD POLONIUS Honest, my lord! HAMLET Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. LORD POLONIUS That's very true, my lord. HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter? LORD POLONIUS I have, my lord. HAMLET Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to 't. LORD POLONIUS [Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord? HAMLET Words, words, words. LORD POLONIUS What is the matter, my lord? HAMLET Between who? LORD POLONIUS I mean, the matter that you read, my lord. HAMLET Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward. LORD POLONIUS [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord? HAMLET Into my grave. LORD POLONIUS Indeed, that is out o' the air. Aside  How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you. HAMLET You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will more willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life. LORD POLONIUS Fare you well, my lord. HAMLET These tedious old fools! Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  LORD POLONIUS You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is. ROSENCRANTZ [To POLONIUS] God save you, sir! Exit POLONIUS  GUILDENSTERN My honoured lord! ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord! HAMLET My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both? ROSENCRANTZ As the indifferent children of the earth. GUILDENSTERN Happy, in that we are not over-happy; On fortune's cap we are not the very button. HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe? ROSENCRANTZ Neither, my lord. HAMLET Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours? GUILDENSTERN 'Faith, her privates we. HAMLET In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What's the news? ROSENCRANTZ None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. HAMLET Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison hither? GUILDENSTERN Prison, my lord! HAMLET Denmark's a prison. ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one. HAMLET A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst. ROSENCRANTZ We think not so, my lord. HAMLET Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison. ROSENCRANTZ Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind. HAMLET O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams. GUILDENSTERN Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow. ROSENCRANTZ Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow. HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason. ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN We'll wait upon you. HAMLET No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? ROSENCRANTZ To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. HAMLET Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. GUILDENSTERN What should we say, my lord? HAMLET Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you. ROSENCRANTZ To what end, my lord? HAMLET That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no? ROSENCRANTZ [Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you? HAMLET [Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold not off. GUILDENSTERN My lord, we were sent for. HAMLET I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so. ROSENCRANTZ My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. HAMLET Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'? ROSENCRANTZ To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service. HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they? ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont to take delight in, the tragedians of the city. HAMLET How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways. ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation. HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? are they so followed? ROSENCRANTZ No, indeed, are they not. HAMLET How comes it? do they grow rusty? ROSENCRANTZ Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither. HAMLET What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players--as it is most like, if their means are no better--their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession? ROSENCRANTZ 'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question. HAMLET Is't possible? GUILDENSTERN O, there has been much throwing about of brains. HAMLET Do the boys carry it away? ROSENCRANTZ Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too. HAMLET It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out. Flourish of trumpets within  GUILDENSTERN There are the players. HAMLET Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived. GUILDENSTERN In what, my dear lord? HAMLET I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw. Enter POLONIUS  LORD POLONIUS Well be with you, gentlemen! HAMLET Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts. ROSENCRANTZ Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child. HAMLET I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed. LORD POLONIUS My lord, I have news to tell you. HAMLET My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,-- LORD POLONIUS The actors are come hither, my lord. HAMLET Buz, buz! LORD POLONIUS Upon mine honour,-- HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass,-- LORD POLONIUS The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical- comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men. HAMLET O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou! LORD POLONIUS What a treasure had he, my lord? HAMLET Why, 'One fair daughter and no more, The which he loved passing well.' LORD POLONIUS [Aside] Still on my daughter. HAMLET Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah? LORD POLONIUS If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well. HAMLET Nay, that follows not. LORD POLONIUS What follows, then, my lord? HAMLET Why, 'As by lot, God wot,' and then, you know, 'It came to pass, as most like it was,'-- the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes. Enter four or five Players  You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech. First Player What speech, my lord? HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it was--as I received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see-- 'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'-- it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:-- 'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, Black as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the ominous horse, Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd With heraldry more dismal; head to foot Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Baked and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and damned light To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore, With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks.' So, proceed you. LORD POLONIUS 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion. First Player 'Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword, Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, Repugnant to command: unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide; But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword, Which was declining on the milky head Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick: So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, And like a neutral to his will and matter, Did nothing. But, as we often see, against some storm, A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, The bold winds speechless and the orb below As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause, Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work; And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword Now falls on Priam. Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods, In general synod 'take away her power; Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven, As low as to the fiends!' LORD POLONIUS This is too long. HAMLET It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba. First Player 'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--' HAMLET 'The mobled queen?' LORD POLONIUS That's good; 'mobled queen' is good. First Player 'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins, A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd, 'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced: But if the gods themselves did see her then When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, The instant burst of clamour that she made, Unless things mortal move them not at all, Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven, And passion in the gods.' LORD POLONIUS Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more. HAMLET 'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live. LORD POLONIUS My lord, I will use them according to their desert. HAMLET God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in. LORD POLONIUS Come, sirs. HAMLET Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First  Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago? First Player Ay, my lord. HAMLET We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could you not? First Player Ay, my lord. HAMLET Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not. Exit First Player  My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore. ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord! HAMLET Ay, so, God be wi' ye; Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  Now I am alone. O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs? who does me this? Ha! 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! O, vengeance! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder'd, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion! Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be the devil: and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds More relative than this: the play 's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. Exit  ACT III SCENE I. A room in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN KING CLAUDIUS And can you, by no drift of circumstance, Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy? ROSENCRANTZ He does confess he feels himself distracted; But from what cause he will by no means speak. GUILDENSTERN Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state. QUEEN GERTRUDE Did he receive you well? ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman. GUILDENSTERN But with much forcing of his disposition. ROSENCRANTZ Niggard of question; but, of our demands, Most free in his reply. QUEEN GERTRUDE Did you assay him? To any pastime? ROSENCRANTZ Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him; And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it: they are about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him. LORD POLONIUS 'Tis most true: And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties To hear and see the matter. KING CLAUDIUS With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose on to these delights. ROSENCRANTZ We shall, my lord. Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  KING CLAUDIUS Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia: Her father and myself, lawful espials, Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behaved, If 't be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for. QUEEN GERTRUDE I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours. OPHELIA Madam, I wish it may. Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE  LORD POLONIUS Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves. To OPHELIA  Read on this book; That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,-- 'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The devil himself. KING CLAUDIUS [Aside] O, 'tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word: O heavy burthen! LORD POLONIUS I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord. Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS  Enter HAMLET  HAMLET To be, or not to be, that is the question, Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.--Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd. OPHELIA Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day? HAMLET I humbly thank you; well, well, well. OPHELIA My lord, I have remembrances of yours, That I have longed long to re-deliver; I pray you, now receive them. HAMLET No, not I; I never gave you aught. OPHELIA My honour'd lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made the things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord. HAMLET Ha, ha! are you honest? OPHELIA My lord? HAMLET Are you fair? OPHELIA What means your lordship? HAMLET That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty. OPHELIA Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty? HAMLET Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once. OPHELIA Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so. HAMLET You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not. OPHELIA I was the more deceived. HAMLET Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father? OPHELIA At home, my lord. HAMLET Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in's own house. Farewell. OPHELIA O, help him, you sweet heavens! HAMLET If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell. OPHELIA O heavenly powers, restore him! HAMLET I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God has given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit  OPHELIA O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see! Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS  KING CLAUDIUS Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul, O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger: which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, For the demand of our neglected tribute Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't? LORD POLONIUS It shall do well: but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief: let her be round with him; And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think. KING CLAUDIUS It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go. Exeunt  SCENE II. A hall in the castle. Enter HAMLET and Players HAMLET Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it. First Player I warrant your honour. HAMLET Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. First Player I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir. HAMLET O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. Exeunt Players  Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN  How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work? LORD POLONIUS And the queen too, and that presently. HAMLET Bid the players make haste. Exit POLONIUS  Will you two help to hasten them? ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN We will, my lord. Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  HAMLET What ho! Horatio! Enter HORATIO  HORATIO Here, sweet lord, at your service. HAMLET Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal. HORATIO O, my dear lord,-- HAMLET Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled, That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.--Something too much of this.-- There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgments join In censure of his seeming. HORATIO Well, my lord: If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft. HAMLET They are coming to the play; I must be idle: Get you a place. Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others  KING CLAUDIUS How fares our cousin Hamlet? HAMLET Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so. KING CLAUDIUS I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine. HAMLET No, nor mine now. To POLONIUS  My lord, you played once i' the university, you say? LORD POLONIUS That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor. HAMLET What did you enact? LORD POLONIUS I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me. HAMLET It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready? ROSENCRANTZ Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience. QUEEN GERTRUDE Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me. HAMLET No, good mother, here's metal more attractive. LORD POLONIUS [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that? HAMLET Lady, shall I lie in your lap? Lying down at OPHELIA's feet  OPHELIA No, my lord. HAMLET I mean, my head upon your lap? OPHELIA Ay, my lord. HAMLET Do you think I meant country matters? OPHELIA I think nothing, my lord. HAMLET That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs. OPHELIA What is, my lord? HAMLET Nothing. OPHELIA You are merry, my lord. HAMLET Who, I? OPHELIA Ay, my lord. HAMLET O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within these two hours. OPHELIA Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord. HAMLET So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches, then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot.' Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters  Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love  Exeunt  OPHELIA What means this, my lord? HAMLET Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief. OPHELIA Belike this show imports the argument of the play. Enter Prologue  HAMLET We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all. OPHELIA Will he tell us what this show meant? HAMLET Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means. OPHELIA You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play. Prologue For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. Exit  HAMLET Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring? OPHELIA 'Tis brief, my lord. HAMLET As woman's love. Enter two Players, King and Queen  Player King Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands. Player Queen So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done! But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For women's fear and love holds quantity; In neither aught, or in extremity. Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there. Player King 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou-- Player Queen O, confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast: In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who kill'd the first. HAMLET [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood. Player Queen The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love: A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed. Player King I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity; Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt: What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead. Player Queen Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope! Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife! HAMLET If she should break it now! Player King 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep. Sleeps  Player Queen Sleep rock thy brain, And never come mischance between us twain! Exit  HAMLET Madam, how like you this play? QUEEN GERTRUDE The lady protests too much, methinks. HAMLET O, but she'll keep her word. KING CLAUDIUS Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't? HAMLET No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world. KING CLAUDIUS What do you call the play? HAMLET The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung. Enter LUCIANUS  This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king. OPHELIA You are as good as a chorus, my lord. HAMLET I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying. OPHELIA You are keen, my lord, you are keen. HAMLET It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge. OPHELIA Still better, and worse. HAMLET So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer; pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come: 'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.' LUCIANUS Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing; Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property, On wholesome life usurp immediately. Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears  HAMLET He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife. OPHELIA The king rises. HAMLET What, frighted with false fire! QUEEN GERTRUDE How fares my lord? LORD POLONIUS Give o'er the play. KING CLAUDIUS Give me some light: away! All Lights, lights, lights! Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO  HAMLET Why, let the stricken deer go weep, The hart ungalled play; For some must watch, while some must sleep: So runs the world away. Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir? HORATIO Half a share. HAMLET A whole one, I. For thou dost know, O Damon dear, This realm dismantled was Of Jove himself; and now reigns here A very, very--pajock. HORATIO You might have rhymed. HAMLET O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive? HORATIO Very well, my lord. HAMLET Upon the talk of the poisoning? HORATIO I did very well note him. HAMLET Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders! For if the king like not the comedy, Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy. Come, some music! Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you. HAMLET Sir, a whole history. GUILDENSTERN The king, sir,-- HAMLET Ay, sir, what of him? GUILDENSTERN Is in his retirement marvellous distempered. HAMLET With drink, sir? GUILDENSTERN No, my lord, rather with choler. HAMLET Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler. GUILDENSTERN Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair. HAMLET I am tame, sir: pronounce. GUILDENSTERN The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you. HAMLET You are welcome. GUILDENSTERN Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business. HAMLET Sir, I cannot. GUILDENSTERN What, my lord? HAMLET Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,-- ROSENCRANTZ Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration. HAMLET O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart. ROSENCRANTZ She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed. HAMLET We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us? ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you once did love me. HAMLET So I do still, by these pickers and stealers. ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend. HAMLET Sir, I lack advancement. ROSENCRANTZ How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark? HAMLET Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb is something musty. Re-enter Players with recorders  O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil? GUILDENSTERN O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly. HAMLET I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe? GUILDENSTERN My lord, I cannot. HAMLET I pray you. GUILDENSTERN Believe me, I cannot. HAMLET I do beseech you. GUILDENSTERN I know no touch of it, my lord. HAMLET 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops. GUILDENSTERN But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill. HAMLET Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me. Enter POLONIUS  God bless you, sir! LORD POLONIUS My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently. HAMLET Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel? LORD POLONIUS By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed. HAMLET Methinks it is like a weasel. LORD POLONIUS It is backed like a weasel. HAMLET Or like a whale? LORD POLONIUS Very like a whale. HAMLET Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by. LORD POLONIUS I will say so. HAMLET By and by is easily said. Exit POLONIUS  Leave me, friends. Exeunt all but HAMLET  Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom: Let me be cruel, not unnatural: I will speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; How in my words soever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit  SCENE III. A room in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN KING CLAUDIUS I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you; I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you: The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow Out of his lunacies. GUILDENSTERN We will ourselves provide: Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your majesty. ROSENCRANTZ The single and peculiar life is bound, With all the strength and armour of the mind, To keep itself from noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest The lives of many. The cease of majesty Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel, Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan. KING CLAUDIUS Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put upon this fear, Which now goes too free-footed. ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN We will haste us. Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  Enter POLONIUS  LORD POLONIUS My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: Behind the arras I'll convey myself, To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home: And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know. KING CLAUDIUS Thanks, dear my lord. Exit POLONIUS  O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, A brother's murder. Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what's in prayer but this two-fold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up; My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'? That cannot be; since I am still possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition and my queen. May one be pardon'd and retain the offence? In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? what rests? Try what repentance can: what can it not? Yet what can it when one can not repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe! All may be well. Retires and kneels  Enter HAMLET  HAMLET Now might I do it pat, now he is praying; And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven; And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd: A villain kills my father; and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge. He took my father grossly, full of bread; With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought, 'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No! Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; At gaming, swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't; Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit  KING CLAUDIUS [Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below: Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit  SCENE IV. The Queen's closet. Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS LORD POLONIUS He will come straight. Look you lay home to him: Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here. Pray you, be round with him. HAMLET [Within] Mother, mother, mother! QUEEN GERTRUDE I'll warrant you, Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming. POLONIUS hides behind the arras  Enter HAMLET  HAMLET Now, mother, what's the matter? QUEEN GERTRUDE Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. HAMLET Mother, you have my father much offended. QUEEN GERTRUDE Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. HAMLET Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. QUEEN GERTRUDE Why, how now, Hamlet! HAMLET What's the matter now? QUEEN GERTRUDE Have you forgot me? HAMLET No, by the rood, not so: You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; And--would it were not so!--you are my mother. QUEEN GERTRUDE Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. HAMLET Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you. QUEEN GERTRUDE What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? Help, help, ho! LORD POLONIUS [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help! HAMLET [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead! Makes a pass through the arras  LORD POLONIUS [Behind] O, I am slain! Falls and dies  QUEEN GERTRUDE O me, what hast thou done? HAMLET Nay, I know not: Is it the king? QUEEN GERTRUDE O, what a rash and bloody deed is this! HAMLET A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother. QUEEN GERTRUDE As kill a king! HAMLET Ay, lady, 'twas my word. Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS  Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune; Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down, And let me wring your heart; for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff, If damned custom have not brass'd it so That it is proof and bulwark against sense. QUEEN GERTRUDE What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me? HAMLET Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul, and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow: Yea, this solidity and compound mass, With tristful visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act. QUEEN GERTRUDE Ay me, what act, That roars so loud, and thunders in the index? HAMLET Look here, upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself; An eye like Mars, to threaten and command; A station like the herald Mercury New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; A combination and a form indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man: This was your husband. Look you now, what follows: Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear, Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd But it reserved some quantity of choice, To serve in such a difference. What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will. QUEEN GERTRUDE O Hamlet, speak no more: Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul; And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct. HAMLET Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty,-- QUEEN GERTRUDE O, speak to me no more; These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears; No more, sweet Hamlet! HAMLET A murderer and a villain; A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket! QUEEN GERTRUDE No more! HAMLET A king of shreds and patches,-- Enter Ghost  Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure? QUEEN GERTRUDE Alas, he's mad! HAMLET Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O, say! Ghost Do not forget: this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: O, step between her and her fighting soul: Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: Speak to her, Hamlet. HAMLET How is it with you, lady? QUEEN GERTRUDE Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look? HAMLET On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones, Would make them capable. Do not look upon me; Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects: then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood. QUEEN GERTRUDE To whom do you speak this? HAMLET Do you see nothing there? QUEEN GERTRUDE Nothing at all; yet all that is I see. HAMLET Nor did you nothing hear? QUEEN GERTRUDE No, nothing but ourselves. HAMLET Why, look you there! look, how it steals away! My father, in his habit as he lived! Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! Exit Ghost  QUEEN GERTRUDE This the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in. HAMLET Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music: it is not madness That I have utter'd: bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that mattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass, but my madness speaks: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whilst rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds, To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good. QUEEN GERTRUDE O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain. HAMLET O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed; Assume a virtue, if you have it not. That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence: the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency. Once more, good night: And when you are desirous to be bless'd, I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, Pointing to POLONIUS  I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so, To punish me with this and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night. I must be cruel, only to be kind: Thus bad begins and worse remains behind. One word more, good lady. QUEEN GERTRUDE What shall I do? HAMLET Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know; For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top. Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep, And break your own neck down. QUEEN GERTRUDE Be thou assured, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me. HAMLET I must to England; you know that? QUEEN GERTRUDE Alack, I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on. HAMLET There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd, They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set me packing: I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor Is now most still, most secret and most grave, Who was in life a foolish prating knave. Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night, mother. Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS  ACT IV SCENE I. A room in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN KING CLAUDIUS There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves: You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them. Where is your son? QUEEN GERTRUDE Bestow this place on us a little while. Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night! KING CLAUDIUS What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet? QUEEN GERTRUDE Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!' And, in this brainish apprehension, kills The unseen good old man. KING CLAUDIUS O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there: His liberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to every one. Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt, This mad young man: but so much was our love, We would not understand what was most fit; But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone? QUEEN GERTRUDE To draw apart the body he hath kill'd: O'er whom his very madness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done. KING CLAUDIUS O Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch, But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed We must, with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern! Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him: Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this. Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; And let them know, both what we mean to do, And what's untimely done. O, come away! My soul is full of discord and dismay. Exeunt  SCENE II. Another room in the castle. Enter HAMLET HAMLET Safely stowed. ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN: [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet! HAMLET What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come. Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  ROSENCRANTZ What have you done, my lord, with the dead body? HAMLET Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin. ROSENCRANTZ Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel. HAMLET Do not believe it. ROSENCRANTZ Believe what? HAMLET That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king? ROSENCRANTZ Take you me for a sponge, my lord? HAMLET Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again. ROSENCRANTZ I understand you not, my lord. HAMLET I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear. ROSENCRANTZ My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king. HAMLET The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing-- GUILDENSTERN A thing, my lord! HAMLET Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after. Exeunt  SCENE III. Another room in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended KING CLAUDIUS I have sent to seek him, and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He's loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all. Enter ROSENCRANTZ  How now! what hath befall'n? ROSENCRANTZ Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, We cannot get from him. KING CLAUDIUS But where is he? ROSENCRANTZ Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure. KING CLAUDIUS Bring him before us. ROSENCRANTZ Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord. Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN  KING CLAUDIUS Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius? HAMLET At supper. KING CLAUDIUS At supper! where? HAMLET Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table: that's the end. KING CLAUDIUS Alas, alas! HAMLET A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. KING CLAUDIUS What dost you mean by this? HAMLET Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. KING CLAUDIUS Where is Polonius? HAMLET In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby. KING CLAUDIUS Go seek him there. To some Attendants  HAMLET He will stay till ye come. Exeunt Attendants  KING CLAUDIUS Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-- Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help, The associates tend, and every thing is bent For England. HAMLET For England! KING CLAUDIUS Ay, Hamlet. HAMLET Good. KING CLAUDIUS So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. HAMLET I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother. KING CLAUDIUS Thy loving father, Hamlet. HAMLET My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England! Exit  KING CLAUDIUS Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard; Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night: Away! for every thing is seal'd and done That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste. Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN  And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught-- As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process; which imports at full, By letters congruing to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done, Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit  SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark. Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching PRINCE FORTINBRAS Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king; Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras Craves the conveyance of a promised march Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous. If that his majesty would aught with us, We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so. Captain I will do't, my lord. PRINCE FORTINBRAS Go softly on. Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers  Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others  HAMLET Good sir, whose powers are these? Captain They are of Norway, sir. HAMLET How purposed, sir, I pray you? Captain Against some part of Poland. HAMLET Who commands them, sir? Captain The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras. HAMLET Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier? Captain Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee. HAMLET Why, then the Polack never will defend it. Captain Yes, it is already garrison'd. HAMLET Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw: This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir. Captain God be wi' you, sir. Exit  ROSENCRANTZ Wilt please you go, my lord? HAMLET I'll be with you straight go a little before. Exeunt all except HAMLET  How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge! What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and god-like reason To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event, A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward, I do not know Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;' Sith I have cause and will and strength and means To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me: Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death and danger dare, Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake. How stand I then, That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men, That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain? O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! Exit  SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle. Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman QUEEN GERTRUDE I will not speak with her. Gentleman She is importunate, indeed distract: Her mood will needs be pitied. QUEEN GERTRUDE What would she have? Gentleman She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they aim at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. HORATIO 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds. QUEEN GERTRUDE Let her come in. Exit HORATIO  To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss: So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA  OPHELIA Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark? QUEEN GERTRUDE How now, Ophelia! OPHELIA [Sings] How should I your true love know From another one? By his cockle hat and staff, And his sandal shoon. QUEEN GERTRUDE Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song? OPHELIA Say you? nay, pray you, mark. Sings  He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone; At his head a grass-green turf, At his heels a stone. QUEEN GERTRUDE Nay, but, Ophelia,-- OPHELIA Pray you, mark. Sings  White his shroud as the mountain snow,-- Enter KING CLAUDIUS  QUEEN GERTRUDE Alas, look here, my lord. OPHELIA [Sings] Larded with sweet flowers Which bewept to the grave did go With true-love showers. KING CLAUDIUS How do you, pretty lady? OPHELIA Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table! KING CLAUDIUS Conceit upon her father. OPHELIA Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this: Sings  To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day, All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window, To be your Valentine. Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes, And dupp'd the chamber-door; Let in the maid, that out a maid Never departed more. KING CLAUDIUS Pretty Ophelia! OPHELIA Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't: Sings  By Gis and by Saint Charity, Alack, and fie for shame! Young men will do't, if they come to't; By cock, they are to blame. Quoth she, before you tumbled me, You promised me to wed. So would I ha' done, by yonder sun, An thou hadst not come to my bed. KING CLAUDIUS How long hath she been thus? OPHELIA I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night. Exit  KING CLAUDIUS Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. Exit HORATIO  O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies But in battalions. First, her father slain: Next, your son gone; and he most violent author Of his own just remove: the people muddied, Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers, For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly, In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts: Last, and as much containing as all these, Her brother is in secret come from France; Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father's death; Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death. A noise within  QUEEN GERTRUDE Alack, what noise is this? KING CLAUDIUS Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door. Enter another Gentleman  What is the matter? Gentleman Save yourself, my lord: The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:' Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds: 'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!' QUEEN GERTRUDE How cheerfully on the false trail they cry! O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs! KING CLAUDIUS The doors are broke. Noise within  Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following  LAERTES Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without. Danes No, let's come in. LAERTES I pray you, give me leave. Danes We will, we will. They retire without the door  LAERTES I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me my father! QUEEN GERTRUDE Calmly, good Laertes. LAERTES That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard, Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother. KING CLAUDIUS What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person: There's such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude. Speak, man. LAERTES Where is my father? KING CLAUDIUS Dead. QUEEN GERTRUDE But not by him. KING CLAUDIUS Let him demand his fill. LAERTES How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with: To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged Most thoroughly for my father. KING CLAUDIUS Who shall stay you? LAERTES My will, not all the world: And for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little. KING CLAUDIUS Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge, That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser? LAERTES None but his enemies. KING CLAUDIUS Will you know them then? LAERTES To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms; And like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood. KING CLAUDIUS Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That I am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensible in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgment pierce As day does to your eye. Danes [Within] Let her come in. LAERTES How now! what noise is that? Re-enter OPHELIA  O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits Should be as moral as an old man's life? Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves. OPHELIA [Sings] They bore him barefaced on the bier; Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny; And in his grave rain'd many a tear:-- Fare you well, my dove! LAERTES Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus. OPHELIA [Sings] You must sing a-down a-down, An you call him a-down-a. O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter. LAERTES This nothing's more than matter. OPHELIA There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts. LAERTES A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted. OPHELIA There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died: they say he made a good end,-- Sings  For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy. LAERTES Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness. OPHELIA [Sings] And will he not come again? And will he not come again? No, no, he is dead: Go to thy death-bed: He never will come again. His beard was as white as snow, All flaxen was his poll: He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan: God ha' mercy on his soul! And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye. Exit  LAERTES Do you see this, O God? KING CLAUDIUS Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will. And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me: If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours, To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content. LAERTES Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure funeral-- No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation-- Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, That I must call't in question. KING CLAUDIUS So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall. I pray you, go with me. Exeunt  SCENE VI. Another room in the castle. Enter HORATIO and a Servant HORATIO What are they that would speak with me? Servant Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you. HORATIO Let them come in. Exit Servant  I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. Enter Sailors  First Sailor God bless you, sir. HORATIO Let him bless thee too. First Sailor He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is. HORATIO [Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. 'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.' Come, I will make you way for these your letters; And do't the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. Exeunt  SCENE VII. Another room in the castle. Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES KING CLAUDIUS Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life. LAERTES It well appears: but tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So crimeful and so capital in nature, As by your safety, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirr'd up. KING CLAUDIUS O, for two special reasons; Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself-- My virtue or my plague, be it either which-- She's so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him; Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, And not where I had aim'd them. LAERTES And so have I a noble father lost; A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections: but my revenge will come. KING CLAUDIUS Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more: I loved your father, and we love ourself; And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-- Enter a Messenger  How now! what news? Messenger Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: This to your majesty; this to the queen. KING CLAUDIUS From Hamlet! who brought them? Messenger Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not: They were given me by Claudio; he received them Of him that brought them. KING CLAUDIUS Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. Exit Messenger  Reads  'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return. 'HAMLET.' What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? LAERTES Know you the hand? KING CLAUDIUS 'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked! And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.' Can you advise me? LAERTES I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come; It warms the very sickness in my heart, That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, 'Thus didest thou.' KING CLAUDIUS If it be so, Laertes-- As how should it be so? how otherwise?-- Will you be ruled by me? LAERTES Ay, my lord; So you will not o'errule me to a peace. KING CLAUDIUS To thine own peace. If he be now return'd, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall: And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practise And call it accident. LAERTES My lord, I will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ. KING CLAUDIUS It falls right. You have been talk'd of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege. LAERTES What part is that, my lord? KING CLAUDIUS A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy:-- I've seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback: but this gallant Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat; And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought, That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did. LAERTES A Norman was't? KING CLAUDIUS A Norman. LAERTES Upon my life, Lamond. KING CLAUDIUS The very same. LAERTES I know him well: he is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation. KING CLAUDIUS He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especially, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him. Now, out of this,-- LAERTES What out of this, my lord? KING CLAUDIUS Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart? LAERTES Why ask you this? KING CLAUDIUS Not that I think you did not love your father; But that I know love is begun by time; And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a plurisy, Dies in his own too much: that we would do We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh, That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:-- Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake, To show yourself your father's son in deed More than in words? LAERTES To cut his throat i' the church. KING CLAUDIUS No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager on your heads: he, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise Requite him for your father. LAERTES I will do't: And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death. KING CLAUDIUS Let's further think of this; Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape: if this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see: We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't. When in your motion you are hot and dry-- As make your bouts more violent to that end-- And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there. Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE  How now, sweet queen! QUEEN GERTRUDE One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes. LAERTES Drown'd! O, where? QUEEN GERTRUDE There is a willow grows aslant a brook, That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; There with fantastic garlands did she come Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke; When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide; And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes; As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element: but long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death. LAERTES Alas, then, she is drown'd? QUEEN GERTRUDE Drown'd, drown'd. LAERTES Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord: I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly douts it. Exit  KING CLAUDIUS Let's follow, Gertrude: How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow. Exeunt  ACT V SCENE I. A churchyard. Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c First Clown Is she to be buried in Christian burial that wilfully seeks her own salvation? Second Clown I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial. First Clown How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence? Second Clown Why, 'tis found so. First Clown It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly. Second Clown Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,-- First Clown Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good; if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. Second Clown But is this law? First Clown Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law. Second Clown Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial. First Clown Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession. Second Clown Was he a gentleman? First Clown He was the first that ever bore arms. Second Clown Why, he had none. First Clown What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:' could he dig without arms? I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself-- Second Clown Go to. First Clown What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? Second Clown The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. First Clown I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come. Second Clown 'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?' First Clown Ay, tell me that, and unyoke. Second Clown Marry, now I can tell. First Clown To't. Second Clown Mass, I cannot tell. Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance  First Clown Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say 'a grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a stoup of liquor. Exit Second Clown  He digs and sings  In youth, when I did love, did love, Methought it was very sweet, To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove, O, methought, there was nothing meet. HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making? HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. HAMLET 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense. First Clown [Sings] But age, with his stealing steps, Hath claw'd me in his clutch, And hath shipped me intil the land, As if I had never been such. Throws up a skull  HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not? HORATIO It might, my lord. HAMLET Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not? HORATIO Ay, my lord. HAMLET Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't. First Clown [Sings] A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade, For and a shrouding sheet: O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. Throws up another skull  HAMLET There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? HORATIO Not a jot more, my lord. HAMLET Is not parchment made of sheepskins? HORATIO Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too. HAMLET They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah? First Clown Mine, sir. Sings  O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet. HAMLET I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't. First Clown You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine. HAMLET 'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest. First Clown 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to you. HAMLET What man dost thou dig it for? First Clown For no man, sir. HAMLET What woman, then? First Clown For none, neither. HAMLET Who is to be buried in't? First Clown One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead. HAMLET How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a grave-maker? First Clown Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. HAMLET How long is that since? First Clown Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England. HAMLET Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? First Clown Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there. HAMLET Why? First Clown 'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he. HAMLET How came he mad? First Clown Very strangely, they say. HAMLET How strangely? First Clown Faith, e'en with losing his wits. HAMLET Upon what ground? First Clown Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years. HAMLET How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot? First Clown I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year. HAMLET Why he more than another? First Clown Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that he will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth three and twenty years. HAMLET Whose was it? First Clown A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was? HAMLET Nay, I know not. First Clown A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester. HAMLET This? First Clown E'en that. HAMLET Let me see. Takes the skull  Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing. HORATIO What's that, my lord? HAMLET Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth? HORATIO E'en so. HAMLET And smelt so? pah! Puts down the skull  HORATIO E'en so, my lord. HAMLET To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bung-hole? HORATIO 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so. HAMLET No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel? Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away: O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw! But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king. Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c  The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate. Couch we awhile, and mark. Retiring with HORATIO  LAERTES What ceremony else? HAMLET That is Laertes, A very noble youth: mark. LAERTES What ceremony else? First Priest Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful; And, but that great command o'ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified have lodged Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers, Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her; Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial. LAERTES Must there no more be done? First Priest No more be done: We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls. LAERTES Lay her i' the earth: And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling. HAMLET What, the fair Ophelia! QUEEN GERTRUDE Sweets to the sweet: farewell! Scattering flowers  I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid, And not have strew'd thy grave. LAERTES O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms: Leaps into the grave  Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head Of blue Olympus. HAMLET [Advancing] What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane. Leaps into the grave  LAERTES The devil take thy soul! Grappling with him  HAMLET Thou pray'st not well. I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I something in me dangerous, Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand. KING CLAUDIUS Pluck them asunder. QUEEN GERTRUDE Hamlet, Hamlet! All Gentlemen,-- HORATIO Good my lord, be quiet. The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave  HAMLET Why I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag. QUEEN GERTRUDE O my son, what theme? HAMLET I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her? KING CLAUDIUS O, he is mad, Laertes. QUEEN GERTRUDE For love of God, forbear him. HAMLET 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do: Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I: And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou. QUEEN GERTRUDE This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping. HAMLET Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I loved you ever: but it is no matter; Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day. Exit  KING CLAUDIUS I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him. Exit HORATIO  To LAERTES  Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech; We'll put the matter to the present push. Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument: An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. Exeunt  SCENE II. A hall in the castle. Enter HAMLET and HORATIO HAMLET So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; You do remember all the circumstance? HORATIO Remember it, my lord? HAMLET Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep: methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, And praised be rashness for it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will,-- HORATIO That is most certain. HAMLET Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark Groped I to find out them; had my desire. Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again; making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,-- O royal knavery!--an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health and England's too, With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off. HORATIO Is't possible? HAMLET Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed? HORATIO I beseech you. HAMLET Being thus be-netted round with villanies,-- Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play--I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair and labour'd much How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote? HORATIO Ay, good my lord. HAMLET An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such-like 'As'es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents, Without debatement further, more or less, He should the bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving-time allow'd. HORATIO How was this seal'd? HAMLET Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in form of the other, Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already. HORATIO So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't. HAMLET Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites. HORATIO Why, what a king is this! HAMLET Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon-- He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil? HORATIO It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there. HAMLET It will be short: the interim is mine; And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.' But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours. But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion. HORATIO Peace! who comes here? Enter OSRIC  OSRIC Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. HAMLET I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly? HORATIO No, my good lord. HAMLET Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt. OSRIC Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty. HAMLET I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. OSRIC I thank your lordship, it is very hot. HAMLET No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly. OSRIC It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. HAMLET But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. OSRIC Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,-- HAMLET I beseech you, remember-- HAMLET moves him to put on his hat  OSRIC Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see. HAMLET Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more. OSRIC Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. HAMLET The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath? OSRIC Sir? HORATIO Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't, sir, really. HAMLET What imports the nomination of this gentleman? OSRIC Of Laertes? HORATIO His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent. HAMLET Of him, sir. OSRIC I know you are not ignorant-- HAMLET I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir? OSRIC You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-- HAMLET I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself. OSRIC I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed. HAMLET What's his weapon? OSRIC Rapier and dagger. HAMLET That's two of his weapons: but, well. OSRIC The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit. HAMLET What call you the carriages? HORATIO I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done. OSRIC The carriages, sir, are the hangers. HAMLET The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it? OSRIC The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer. HAMLET How if I answer 'no'? OSRIC I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. HAMLET Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. OSRIC Shall I re-deliver you e'en so? HAMLET To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will. OSRIC I commend my duty to your lordship. HAMLET Yours, yours. Exit OSRIC  He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn. HORATIO This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. HAMLET He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it. Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. Enter a Lord  Lord My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time. HAMLET I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now. Lord The king and queen and all are coming down. HAMLET In happy time. Lord The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play. HAMLET She well instructs me. Exit Lord  HORATIO You will lose this wager, my lord. HAMLET I do not think so: since he went into France, I have been in continual practise: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter. HORATIO Nay, good my lord,-- HAMLET It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman. HORATIO If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit. HAMLET Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes? Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c  KING CLAUDIUS Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's  HAMLET Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong; But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd With sore distraction. What I have done, That might your nature, honour and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd; His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother. LAERTES I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge: but in my terms of honour I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters, of known honour, I have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungored. But till that time, I do receive your offer'd love like love, And will not wrong it. HAMLET I embrace it freely; And will this brother's wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Come on. LAERTES Come, one for me. HAMLET I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed. LAERTES You mock me, sir. HAMLET No, by this hand. KING CLAUDIUS Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager? HAMLET Very well, my lord Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side. KING CLAUDIUS I do not fear it; I have seen you both: But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds. LAERTES This is too heavy, let me see another. HAMLET This likes me well. These foils have all a length? They prepare to play  OSRIC Ay, my good lord. KING CLAUDIUS Set me the stoops of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire: The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, 'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. HAMLET Come on, sir. LAERTES Come, my lord. They play  HAMLET One. LAERTES No. HAMLET Judgment. OSRIC A hit, a very palpable hit. LAERTES Well; again. KING CLAUDIUS Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health. Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within  Give him the cup. HAMLET I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. They play  Another hit; what say you? LAERTES A touch, a touch, I do confess. KING CLAUDIUS Our son shall win. QUEEN GERTRUDE He's fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows; The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet. HAMLET Good madam! KING CLAUDIUS Gertrude, do not drink. QUEEN GERTRUDE I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me. KING CLAUDIUS [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late. HAMLET I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by. QUEEN GERTRUDE Come, let me wipe thy face. LAERTES My lord, I'll hit him now. KING CLAUDIUS I do not think't. LAERTES [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience. HAMLET Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally; I pray you, pass with your best violence; I am afeard you make a wanton of me. LAERTES Say you so? come on. They play  OSRIC Nothing, neither way. LAERTES Have at you now! LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES  KING CLAUDIUS Part them; they are incensed. HAMLET Nay, come, again. QUEEN GERTRUDE falls  OSRIC Look to the queen there, ho! HORATIO They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord? OSRIC How is't, Laertes? LAERTES Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric; I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery. HAMLET How does the queen? KING CLAUDIUS She swounds to see them bleed. QUEEN GERTRUDE No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,-- The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Dies  HAMLET O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd: Treachery! Seek it out. LAERTES It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie, Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame. HAMLET The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work. Stabs KING CLAUDIUS  All Treason! treason! KING CLAUDIUS O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt. HAMLET Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. KING CLAUDIUS dies  LAERTES He is justly served; It is a poison temper'd by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Dies  HAMLET Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you-- But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied. HORATIO Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left. HAMLET As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story. March afar off, and shot within  What warlike noise is this? OSRIC Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley. HAMLET O, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England; But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Dies  HORATIO Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither? March within  Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others  PRINCE FORTINBRAS Where is this sight? HORATIO What is it ye would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. PRINCE FORTINBRAS This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck? First Ambassador The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late: The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: Where should we have our thanks? HORATIO Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I Truly deliver. PRINCE FORTINBRAS Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune: I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. HORATIO Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more; But let this same be presently perform'd, Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance On plots and errors, happen. PRINCE FORTINBRAS Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royally: and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rites of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies: such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot. A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off  ACT I SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard. Enter a Master and a Boatswain  Master Boatswain! Boatswain Here, master: what cheer? Master Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir. Exit  Enter Mariners  Boatswain Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough! Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others  ALONSO Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master? Play the men. Boatswain I pray now, keep below. ANTONIO Where is the master, boatswain? Boatswain Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm. GONZALO Nay, good, be patient. Boatswain When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not. GONZALO Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. Boatswain None that I more love than myself. You are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out of our way, I say. Exit  GONZALO I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable. Exeunt  Re-enter Boatswain  Boatswain Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try with main-course. A cry within  A plague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather or our office. Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO  Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er and drown? Have you a mind to sink? SEBASTIAN A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog! Boatswain Work you then. ANTONIO Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art. GONZALO I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench. Boatswain Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to sea again; lay her off. Enter Mariners wet  Mariners All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost! Boatswain What, must our mouths be cold? GONZALO The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them, For our case is as theirs. SEBASTIAN I'm out of patience. ANTONIO We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards: This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning The washing of ten tides! GONZALO He'll be hang'd yet, Though every drop of water swear against it And gape at widest to glut him. A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'  ANTONIO Let's all sink with the king. SEBASTIAN Let's take leave of him. Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN  GONZALO Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a dry death. Exeunt  SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell. Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA MIRANDA If by your art, my dearest father, you have Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. Had I been any god of power, I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallow'd and The fraughting souls within her. PROSPERO Be collected: No more amazement: tell your piteous heart There's no harm done. MIRANDA O, woe the day! PROSPERO No harm. I have done nothing but in care of thee, Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing Of whence I am, nor that I am more better Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, And thy no greater father. MIRANDA More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts. PROSPERO 'Tis time I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand, And pluck my magic garment from me. So: Lays down his mantle  Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely ordered that there is no soul-- No, not so much perdition as an hair Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down; For thou must now know farther. MIRANDA You have often Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd And left me to a bootless inquisition, Concluding 'Stay: not yet.' PROSPERO The hour's now come; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not Out three years old. MIRANDA Certainly, sir, I can. PROSPERO By what? by any other house or person? Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance. MIRANDA 'Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? PROSPERO Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst. MIRANDA But that I do not. PROSPERO Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power. MIRANDA Sir, are not you my father? PROSPERO Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir And princess no worse issued. MIRANDA O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? Or blessed was't we did? PROSPERO Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, But blessedly holp hither. MIRANDA O, my heart bleeds To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to, Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. PROSPERO My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio-- I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself Of all the world I loved and to him put The manage of my state; as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-- Dost thou attend me? MIRANDA Sir, most heedfully. PROSPERO Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, who to advance and who To trash for over-topping, new created The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em, Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. MIRANDA O, good sir, I do. PROSPERO I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which, but by being so retired, O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature; and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, Made such a sinner of his memory, To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution And executing the outward face of royalty, With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing-- Dost thou hear? MIRANDA Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. PROSPERO To have no screen between this part he play'd And him he play'd it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable; confederates-- So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!-- To most ignoble stooping. MIRANDA O the heavens! PROSPERO Mark his condition and the event; then tell me If this might be a brother. MIRANDA I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother: Good wombs have borne bad sons. PROSPERO Now the condition. The King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother: whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to the purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, The ministers for the purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self. MIRANDA Alack, for pity! I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to't. PROSPERO Hear a little further And then I'll bring thee to the present business Which now's upon's; without the which this story Were most impertinent. MIRANDA Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us? PROSPERO Well demanded, wench: My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, So dear the love my people bore me, nor set A mark so bloody on the business, but With colours fairer painted their foul ends. In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh To the winds whose pity, sighing back again, Did us but loving wrong. MIRANDA Alack, what trouble Was I then to you! PROSPERO O, a cherubim Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile. Infused with a fortitude from heaven, When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me An undergoing stomach, to bear up Against what should ensue. MIRANDA How came we ashore? PROSPERO By Providence divine. Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, Out of his charity, being then appointed Master of this design, did give us, with Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness, Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom. MIRANDA Would I might But ever see that man! PROSPERO Now I arise: Resumes his mantle  Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. Here in this island we arrived; and here Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit Than other princesses can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful. MIRANDA Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason For raising this sea-storm? PROSPERO Know thus far forth. By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought to this shore; and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, And give it way: I know thou canst not choose. MIRANDA sleeps  Come away, servant, come. I am ready now. Approach, my Ariel, come. Enter ARIEL  ARIEL All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality. PROSPERO Hast thou, spirit, Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? ARIEL To every article. I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide, And burn in many places; on the topmast, The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, Yea, his dread trident shake. PROSPERO My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason? ARIEL Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and play'd Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty And all the devils are here.' PROSPERO Why that's my spirit! But was not this nigh shore? ARIEL Close by, my master. PROSPERO But are they, Ariel, safe? ARIEL Not a hair perish'd; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. The king's son have I landed by himself; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting, His arms in this sad knot. PROSPERO Of the king's ship The mariners say how thou hast disposed And all the rest o' the fleet. ARIEL Safely in harbour Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: The mariners all under hatches stow'd; Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour, I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet Which I dispersed, they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean flote, Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd And his great person perish. PROSPERO Ariel, thy charge Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. What is the time o' the day? ARIEL Past the mid season. PROSPERO At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously. ARIEL Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet perform'd me. PROSPERO How now? moody? What is't thou canst demand? ARIEL My liberty. PROSPERO Before the time be out? no more! ARIEL I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service; Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise To bate me a full year. PROSPERO Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee? ARIEL No. PROSPERO Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o' the earth When it is baked with frost. ARIEL I do not, sir. PROSPERO Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? ARIEL No, sir. PROSPERO Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. ARIEL Sir, in Argier. PROSPERO O, was she so? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did They would not take her life. Is not this true? ARIEL Ay, sir. PROSPERO This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with A human shape. ARIEL Yes, Caliban her son. PROSPERO Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears: it was a torment To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax Could not again undo: it was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine and let thee out. ARIEL I thank thee, master. PROSPERO If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters. ARIEL Pardon, master; I will be correspondent to command And do my spiriting gently. PROSPERO Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee. ARIEL That's my noble master! What shall I do? say what; what shall I do? PROSPERO Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject To no sight but thine and mine, invisible To every eyeball else. Go take this shape And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence! Exit ARIEL  Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake! MIRANDA The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me. PROSPERO Shake it off. Come on; We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never Yields us kind answer. MIRANDA 'Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. PROSPERO But, as 'tis, We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood and serves in offices That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. CALIBAN [Within] There's wood enough within. PROSPERO Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee: Come, thou tortoise! when? Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph  Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear. ARIEL My lord it shall be done. Exit  PROSPERO Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! Enter CALIBAN  CALIBAN As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd With raven's feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye And blister you all o'er! PROSPERO For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made 'em. CALIBAN I must eat my dinner. This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me Water with berries in't, and teach me how To name the bigger light, and how the less, That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: Cursed be I that did so! All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o' the island. PROSPERO Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child. CALIBAN O ho, O ho! would't had been done! Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else This isle with Calibans. PROSPERO Abhorred slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes With words that made them known. But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison. CALIBAN You taught me language; and my profit on't Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you For learning me your language! PROSPERO Hag-seed, hence! Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best, To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice? If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps, Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar That beasts shall tremble at thy din. CALIBAN No, pray thee. Aside  I must obey: his art is of such power, It would control my dam's god, Setebos, and make a vassal of him. PROSPERO So, slave; hence! Exit CALIBAN  Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following  ARIEL'S song. Come unto these yellow sands, And then take hands: Courtsied when you have and kiss'd The wild waves whist, Foot it featly here and there; And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear. Hark, hark! Burthen [dispersedly, within  The watch-dogs bark! Burthen Bow-wow  Hark, hark! I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow. FERDINAND Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth? It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the king my father's wreck, This music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it, Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone. No, it begins again. ARIEL sings  Full fathom five thy father lies; Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes: Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell Burthen Ding-dong  Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell. FERDINAND The ditty does remember my drown'd father. This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes. I hear it now above me. PROSPERO The fringed curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond. MIRANDA What is't? a spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit. PROSPERO No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em. MIRANDA I might call him A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble. PROSPERO [Aside] It goes on, I see, As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee Within two days for this. FERDINAND Most sure, the goddess On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer May know if you remain upon this island; And that you will some good instruction give How I may bear me here: my prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder! If you be maid or no? MIRANDA No wonder, sir; But certainly a maid. FERDINAND My language! heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where 'tis spoken. PROSPERO How? the best? What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? FERDINAND A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me; And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld The king my father wreck'd. MIRANDA Alack, for mercy! FERDINAND Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain. PROSPERO [Aside] The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee, If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel, I'll set thee free for this. To FERDINAND  A word, good sir; I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word. MIRANDA Why speaks my father so ungently? This Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father To be inclined my way! FERDINAND O, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you The queen of Naples. PROSPERO Soft, sir! one word more. Aside  They are both in either's powers; but this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light. To FERDINAND  One word more; I charge thee That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord on't. FERDINAND No, as I am a man. MIRANDA There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with't. PROSPERO Follow me. Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come; I'll manacle thy neck and feet together: Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow. FERDINAND No; I will resist such entertainment till Mine enemy has more power. Draws, and is charmed from moving  MIRANDA O dear father, Make not too rash a trial of him, for He's gentle and not fearful. PROSPERO What? I say, My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward, For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop. MIRANDA Beseech you, father. PROSPERO Hence! hang not on my garments. MIRANDA Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety. PROSPERO Silence! one word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! An advocate for an imposter! hush! Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! To the most of men this is a Caliban And they to him are angels. MIRANDA My affections Are then most humble; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man. PROSPERO Come on; obey: Thy nerves are in their infancy again And have no vigour in them. FERDINAND So they are; My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My father's loss, the weakness which I feel, The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth Let liberty make use of; space enough Have I in such a prison. PROSPERO [Aside] It works. To FERDINAND  Come on. Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! To FERDINAND  Follow me. To ARIEL  Hark what thou else shalt do me. MIRANDA Be of comfort; My father's of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted Which now came from him. PROSPERO Thou shalt be free As mountain winds: but then exactly do All points of my command. ARIEL To the syllable. PROSPERO Come, follow. Speak not for him. Exeunt  ACT II SCENE I. Another part of the island. Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others GONZALO Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause, So have we all, of joy; for our escape Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe Is common; every day some sailor's wife, The masters of some merchant and the merchant Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle, I mean our preservation, few in millions Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh Our sorrow with our comfort. ALONSO Prithee, peace. SEBASTIAN He receives comfort like cold porridge. ANTONIO The visitor will not give him o'er so. SEBASTIAN Look he's winding up the watch of his wit; by and by it will strike. GONZALO Sir,-- SEBASTIAN One: tell. GONZALO When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd, Comes to the entertainer-- SEBASTIAN A dollar. GONZALO Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken truer than you purposed. SEBASTIAN You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should. GONZALO Therefore, my lord,-- ANTONIO Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue! ALONSO I prithee, spare. GONZALO Well, I have done: but yet,-- SEBASTIAN He will be talking. ANTONIO Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow? SEBASTIAN The old cock. ANTONIO The cockerel. SEBASTIAN Done. The wager? ANTONIO A laughter. SEBASTIAN A match! ADRIAN Though this island seem to be desert,-- SEBASTIAN Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid. ADRIAN Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,-- SEBASTIAN Yet,-- ADRIAN Yet,-- ANTONIO He could not miss't. ADRIAN It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate temperance. ANTONIO Temperance was a delicate wench. SEBASTIAN Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered. ADRIAN The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. SEBASTIAN As if it had lungs and rotten ones. ANTONIO Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen. GONZALO Here is everything advantageous to life. ANTONIO True; save means to live. SEBASTIAN Of that there's none, or little. GONZALO How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green! ANTONIO The ground indeed is tawny. SEBASTIAN With an eye of green in't. ANTONIO He misses not much. SEBASTIAN No; he doth but mistake the truth totally. GONZALO But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost beyond credit,-- SEBASTIAN As many vouched rarities are. GONZALO That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water. ANTONIO If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies? SEBASTIAN Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report GONZALO Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis. SEBASTIAN 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return. ADRIAN Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen. GONZALO Not since widow Dido's time. ANTONIO Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in? widow Dido! SEBASTIAN What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord, how you take it! ADRIAN 'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that: she was of Carthage, not of Tunis. GONZALO This Tunis, sir, was Carthage. ADRIAN Carthage? GONZALO I assure you, Carthage. SEBASTIAN His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath raised the wall and houses too. ANTONIO What impossible matter will he make easy next? SEBASTIAN I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple. ANTONIO And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands. GONZALO Ay. ANTONIO Why, in good time. GONZALO Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen. ANTONIO And the rarest that e'er came there. SEBASTIAN Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido. ANTONIO O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido. GONZALO Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort. ANTONIO That sort was well fished for. GONZALO When I wore it at your daughter's marriage? ALONSO You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense. Would I had never Married my daughter there! for, coming thence, My son is lost and, in my rate, she too, Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee? FRANCISCO Sir, he may live: I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs; he trod the water, Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head 'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd, As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt He came alive to land. ALONSO No, no, he's gone. SEBASTIAN Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African; Where she at least is banish'd from your eye, Who hath cause to wet the grief on't. ALONSO Prithee, peace. SEBASTIAN You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son, I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business' making Than we bring men to comfort them: The fault's your own. ALONSO So is the dear'st o' the loss. GONZALO My lord Sebastian, The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in: you rub the sore, When you should bring the plaster. SEBASTIAN Very well. ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly. GONZALO It is foul weather in us all, good sir, When you are cloudy. SEBASTIAN Foul weather? ANTONIO Very foul. GONZALO Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,-- ANTONIO He'ld sow't with nettle-seed. SEBASTIAN Or docks, or mallows. GONZALO And were the king on't, what would I do? SEBASTIAN 'Scape being drunk for want of wine. GONZALO I' the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things; for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, succession, Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty;-- SEBASTIAN Yet he would be king on't. ANTONIO The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning. GONZALO All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony, Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine, Would I not have; but nature should bring forth, Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people. SEBASTIAN No marrying 'mong his subjects? ANTONIO None, man; all idle: whores and knaves. GONZALO I would with such perfection govern, sir, To excel the golden age. SEBASTIAN God save his majesty! ANTONIO Long live Gonzalo! GONZALO And,--do you mark me, sir? ALONSO Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me. GONZALO I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing. ANTONIO 'Twas you we laughed at. GONZALO Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you: so you may continue and laugh at nothing still. ANTONIO What a blow was there given! SEBASTIAN An it had not fallen flat-long. GONZALO You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing. Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music  SEBASTIAN We would so, and then go a bat-fowling. ANTONIO Nay, good my lord, be not angry. GONZALO No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy? ANTONIO Go sleep, and hear us. All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO  ALONSO What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find They are inclined to do so. SEBASTIAN Please you, sir, Do not omit the heavy offer of it: It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth, It is a comforter. ANTONIO We two, my lord, Will guard your person while you take your rest, And watch your safety. ALONSO Thank you. Wondrous heavy. ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL  SEBASTIAN What a strange drowsiness possesses them! ANTONIO It is the quality o' the climate. SEBASTIAN Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not Myself disposed to sleep. ANTONIO Nor I; my spirits are nimble. They fell together all, as by consent; They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might, Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:-- And yet me thinks I see it in thy face, What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head. SEBASTIAN What, art thou waking? ANTONIO Do you not hear me speak? SEBASTIAN I do; and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, And yet so fast asleep. ANTONIO Noble Sebastian, Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st Whiles thou art waking. SEBASTIAN Thou dost snore distinctly; There's meaning in thy snores. ANTONIO I am more serious than my custom: you Must be so too, if heed me; which to do Trebles thee o'er. SEBASTIAN Well, I am standing water. ANTONIO I'll teach you how to flow. SEBASTIAN Do so: to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me. ANTONIO O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it, You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed, Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth. SEBASTIAN Prithee, say on: The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee, and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield. ANTONIO Thus, sir: Although this lord of weak remembrance, this, Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,-- For he's a spirit of persuasion, only Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive, 'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd And he that sleeps here swims. SEBASTIAN I have no hope That he's undrown'd. ANTONIO O, out of that 'no hope' What great hope have you! no hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond, But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drown'd? SEBASTIAN He's gone. ANTONIO Then, tell me, Who's the next heir of Naples? SEBASTIAN Claribel. ANTONIO She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples Can have no note, unless the sun were post-- The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom? We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again, And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come In yours and my discharge. SEBASTIAN What stuff is this! how say you? 'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions There is some space. ANTONIO A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis, And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore The mind that I do! what a sleep were this For your advancement! Do you understand me? SEBASTIAN Methinks I do. ANTONIO And how does your content Tender your own good fortune? SEBASTIAN I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero. ANTONIO True: And look how well my garments sit upon me; Much feater than before: my brother's servants Were then my fellows; now they are my men. SEBASTIAN But, for your conscience? ANTONIO Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe, 'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences, That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon, If he were that which now he's like, that's dead; Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus, To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest, They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk; They'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour. SEBASTIAN Thy case, dear friend, Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan, I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest; And I the king shall love thee. ANTONIO Draw together; And when I rear my hand, do you the like, To fall it on Gonzalo. SEBASTIAN O, but one word. They talk apart  Re-enter ARIEL, invisible  ARIEL My master through his art foresees the danger That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth-- For else his project dies--to keep them living. Sings in GONZALO's ear  While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take. If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware: Awake, awake! ANTONIO Then let us both be sudden. GONZALO Now, good angels Preserve the king. They wake  ALONSO Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn? Wherefore this ghastly looking? GONZALO What's the matter? SEBASTIAN Whiles we stood here securing your repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you? It struck mine ear most terribly. ALONSO I heard nothing. ANTONIO O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear, To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions. ALONSO Heard you this, Gonzalo? GONZALO Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me: I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd, I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise, That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard, Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons. ALONSO Lead off this ground; and let's make further search For my poor son. GONZALO Heavens keep him from these beasts! For he is, sure, i' the island. ALONSO Lead away. ARIEL Prospero my lord shall know what I have done: So, king, go safely on to seek thy son. Exeunt  SCENE II. Another part of the island. Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard CALIBAN All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire, Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but For every trifle are they set upon me; Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness. Enter TRINCULO  Lo, now, lo! Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat; Perchance he will not mind me. TRINCULO Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish- like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor- John. A strange fish! Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. Thunder  Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past. Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand  STEPHANO I shall no more to sea, to sea, Here shall I die ashore-- This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral: well, here's my comfort. Drinks  Sings  The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I, The gunner and his mate Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery, But none of us cared for Kate; For she had a tongue with a tang, Would cry to a sailor, Go hang! She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch, Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch: Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang! This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort. Drinks  CALIBAN Do not torment me: Oh! STEPHANO What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at's nostrils. CALIBAN The spirit torments me; Oh! STEPHANO This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather. CALIBAN Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster. STEPHANO He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly. CALIBAN Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee. STEPHANO Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend: open your chaps again. TRINCULO I should know that voice: it should be--but he is drowned; and these are devils: O defend me! STEPHANO Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster! His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth. TRINCULO Stephano! STEPHANO Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no long spoon. TRINCULO Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy good friend Trinculo. STEPHANO If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos? TRINCULO I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped! STEPHANO Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant. CALIBAN [Aside] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites. That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor. I will kneel to him. STEPHANO How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither? swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore. CALIBAN I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject; for the liquor is not earthly. STEPHANO Here; swear then how thou escapedst. TRINCULO Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I'll be sworn. STEPHANO Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose. TRINCULO O Stephano. hast any more of this? STEPHANO The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! how does thine ague? CALIBAN Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven? STEPHANO Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i' the moon when time was. CALIBAN I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee: My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush. STEPHANO Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish it anon with new contents swear. TRINCULO By this good light, this is a very shallow monster! I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i' the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well drawn, monster, in good sooth! CALIBAN I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island; And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god. TRINCULO By this light, a most perfidious and drunken monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle. CALIBAN I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject. STEPHANO Come on then; down, and swear. TRINCULO I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my heart to beat him,-- STEPHANO Come, kiss. TRINCULO But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster! CALIBAN I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries; I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant that I serve! I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man. TRINCULO A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a Poor drunkard! CALIBAN I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts; Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me? STEPHANO I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again. CALIBAN [Sings drunkenly] Farewell master; farewell, farewell! TRINCULO A howling monster: a drunken monster! CALIBAN No more dams I'll make for fish Nor fetch in firing At requiring; Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish 'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban Has a new master: get a new man. Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, hey-day, freedom! STEPHANO O brave monster! Lead the way. Exeunt  ACT III SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell. Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log FERDINAND There be some sports are painful, and their labour Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone and most poor matters Point to rich ends. This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, And he's composed of harshness. I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up, Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness Had never like executor. I forget: But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busy lest, when I do it. Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen  MIRANDA Alas, now, pray you, Work not so hard: I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile! Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns, 'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself; He's safe for these three hours. FERDINAND O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do. MIRANDA If you'll sit down, I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that; I'll carry it to the pile. FERDINAND No, precious creature; I had rather crack my sinews, break my back, Than you should such dishonour undergo, While I sit lazy by. MIRANDA It would become me As well as it does you: and I should do it With much more ease; for my good will is to it, And yours it is against. PROSPERO Poor worm, thou art infected! This visitation shows it. MIRANDA You look wearily. FERDINAND No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night. I do beseech you-- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers-- What is your name? MIRANDA Miranda.--O my father, I have broke your hest to say so! FERDINAND Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration! worth What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so fun soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature's best! MIRANDA I do not know One of my sex; no woman's face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you, Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly and my father's precepts I therein do forget. FERDINAND I am in my condition A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; I would, not so!--and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log--man. MIRANDA Do you love me? FERDINAND O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event If I speak true! if hollowly, invert What best is boded me to mischief! I Beyond all limit of what else i' the world Do love, prize, honour you. MIRANDA I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of. PROSPERO Fair encounter Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between 'em! FERDINAND Wherefore weep you? MIRANDA At mine unworthiness that dare not offer What I desire to give, and much less take What I shall die to want. But this is trifling; And all the more it seeks to hide itself, The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning! And prompt me, plain and holy innocence! I am your wife, if you will marry me; If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow You may deny me; but I'll be your servant, Whether you will or no. FERDINAND My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever. MIRANDA My husband, then? FERDINAND Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand. MIRANDA And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell Till half an hour hence. FERDINAND A thousand thousand! Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally  PROSPERO So glad of this as they I cannot be, Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing At nothing can be more. I'll to my book, For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining. Exit  SCENE II. Another part of the island. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO STEPHANO Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me. TRINCULO Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They say there's but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the state totters. STEPHANO Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy head. TRINCULO Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. STEPHANO My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. TRINCULO Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard. STEPHANO We'll not run, Monsieur Monster. TRINCULO Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither. STEPHANO Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf. CALIBAN How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I'll not serve him; he's not valiant. TRINCULO Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? CALIBAN Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? TRINCULO 'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural! CALIBAN Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee. STEPHANO Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's my subject and he shall not suffer indignity. CALIBAN I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee? STEPHANO Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand, and so shall Trinculo. Enter ARIEL, invisible  CALIBAN As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island. ARIEL Thou liest. CALIBAN Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie. STEPHANO Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth. TRINCULO Why, I said nothing. STEPHANO Mum, then, and no more. Proceed. CALIBAN I say, by sorcery he got this isle; From me he got it. if thy greatness will Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest, But this thing dare not,-- STEPHANO That's most certain. CALIBAN Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee. STEPHANO How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou bring me to the party? CALIBAN Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep, Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead. ARIEL Thou liest; thou canst not. CALIBAN What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch! I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows And take his bottle from him: when that's gone He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him Where the quick freshes are. STEPHANO Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the monster one word further, and, by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors and make a stock-fish of thee. TRINCULO Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther off. STEPHANO Didst thou not say he lied? ARIEL Thou liest. STEPHANO Do I so? take thou that. Beats TRINCULO  As you like this, give me the lie another time. TRINCULO I did not give the lie. Out o' your wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle! this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers! CALIBAN Ha, ha, ha! STEPHANO Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther off. CALIBAN Beat him enough: after a little time I'll beat him too. STEPHANO Stand farther. Come, proceed. CALIBAN Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him, I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books, or with a log Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember First to possess his books; for without them He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command: they all do hate him As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them-- Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter; he himself Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman, But only Sycorax my dam and she; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great'st does least. STEPHANO Is it so brave a lass? CALIBAN Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant. And bring thee forth brave brood. STEPHANO Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I will be king and queen--save our graces!--and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo? TRINCULO Excellent. STEPHANO Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but, while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head. CALIBAN Within this half hour will he be asleep: Wilt thou destroy him then? STEPHANO Ay, on mine honour. ARIEL This will I tell my master. CALIBAN Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure: Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch You taught me but while-ere? STEPHANO At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing. Sings  Flout 'em and scout 'em And scout 'em and flout 'em Thought is free. CALIBAN That's not the tune. Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe  STEPHANO What is this same? TRINCULO This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody. STEPHANO If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list. TRINCULO O, forgive me my sins! STEPHANO He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us! CALIBAN Art thou afeard? STEPHANO No, monster, not I. CALIBAN Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked, I cried to dream again. STEPHANO This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing. CALIBAN When Prospero is destroyed. STEPHANO That shall be by and by: I remember the story. TRINCULO The sound is going away; let's follow it, and after do our work. STEPHANO Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see this tabourer; he lays it on. TRINCULO Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano. Exeunt  SCENE III. Another part of the island. Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others GONZALO By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir; My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience, I needs must rest me. ALONSO Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attach'd with weariness, To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest. Even here I will put off my hope and keep it No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go. ANTONIO [Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so out of hope. Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose That you resolved to effect. SEBASTIAN [Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage Will we take throughly. ANTONIO [Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night; For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance As when they are fresh. SEBASTIAN [Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more. Solemn and strange music  ALONSO What harmony is this? My good friends, hark! GONZALO Marvellous sweet music! Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King, & c. to eat, they depart  ALONSO Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these? SEBASTIAN A living drollery. Now I will believe That there are unicorns, that in Arabia There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix At this hour reigning there. ANTONIO I'll believe both; And what does else want credit, come to me, And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did lie, Though fools at home condemn 'em. GONZALO If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me? If I should say, I saw such islanders-- For, certes, these are people of the island-- Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note, Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any. PROSPERO [Aside] Honest lord, Thou hast said well; for some of you there present Are worse than devils. ALONSO I cannot too much muse Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing, Although they want the use of tongue, a kind Of excellent dumb discourse. PROSPERO [Aside] Praise in departing. FRANCISCO They vanish'd strangely. SEBASTIAN No matter, since They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs. Will't please you taste of what is here? ALONSO Not I. GONZALO Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of. ALONSO I will stand to and feed, Although my last: no matter, since I feel The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke, Stand to and do as we. Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes  ARIEL You are three men of sin, whom Destiny, That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad; And even with such-like valour men hang and drown Their proper selves. ALONSO, SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords  You fools! I and my fellows Are ministers of Fate: the elements, Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths And will not be uplifted. But remember-- For that's my business to you--that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero; Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso, They have bereft; and do pronounce by me: Lingering perdition, worse than any death Can be at once, shall step by step attend You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from-- Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow And a clear life ensuing. He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table  PROSPERO Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring: Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life And observation strange, my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done. My high charms work And these mine enemies are all knit up In their distractions; they now are in my power; And in these fits I leave them, while I visit Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd, And his and mine loved darling. Exit above  GONZALO I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you In this strange stare? ALONSO O, it is monstrous, monstrous: Methought the billows spoke and told me of it; The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder, That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass. Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded And with him there lie mudded. Exit  SEBASTIAN But one fiend at a time, I'll fight their legions o'er. ANTONIO I'll be thy second. Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO  GONZALO All three of them are desperate: their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to. ADRIAN Follow, I pray you. Exeunt  ACT IV SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell. Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA PROSPERO If I have too austerely punish'd you, Your compensation makes amends, for I Have given you here a third of mine own life, Or that for which I live; who once again I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations Were but my trials of thy love and thou Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven, I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast her off, For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise And make it halt behind her. FERDINAND I do believe it Against an oracle. PROSPERO Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased take my daughter: but If thou dost break her virgin-knot before All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be minister'd, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow: but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed, As Hymen's lamps shall light you. FERDINAND As I hope For quiet days, fair issue and long life, With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den, The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion. Our worser genius can, shall never melt Mine honour into lust, to take away The edge of that day's celebration When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd, Or Night kept chain'd below. PROSPERO Fairly spoke. Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own. What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! Enter ARIEL  ARIEL What would my potent master? here I am. PROSPERO Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service Did worthily perform; and I must use you In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place: Incite them to quick motion; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise, And they expect it from me. ARIEL Presently? PROSPERO Ay, with a twink. ARIEL Before you can say 'come' and 'go,' And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,' Each one, tripping on his toe, Will be here with mop and mow. Do you love me, master? no? PROSPERO Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach Till thou dost hear me call. ARIEL Well, I conceive. Exit  PROSPERO Look thou be true; do not give dalliance Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious, Or else, good night your vow! FERDINAND I warrant you sir; The white cold virgin snow upon my heart Abates the ardour of my liver. PROSPERO Well. Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly! No tongue! all eyes! be silent. Soft music  Enter IRIS  IRIS Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease; Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep, And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep; Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims, Which spongy April at thy hest betrims, To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves, Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves, Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard; And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard, Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky, Whose watery arch and messenger am I, Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace, Here on this grass-plot, in this very place, To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain: Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain. Enter CERES  CERES Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter; Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers, And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down, Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green? IRIS A contract of true love to celebrate; And some donation freely to estate On the blest lovers. CERES Tell me, heavenly bow, If Venus or her son, as thou dost know, Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot The means that dusky Dis my daughter got, Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company I have forsworn. IRIS Of her society Be not afraid: I met her deity Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done Some wanton charm upon this man and maid, Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain; Mars's hot minion is returned again; Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows And be a boy right out. CERES High'st queen of state, Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait. Enter JUNO  JUNO How does my bounteous sister? Go with me To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be And honour'd in their issue. They sing:  JUNO Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, Long continuance, and increasing, Hourly joys be still upon you! Juno sings her blessings upon you. CERES Earth's increase, foison plenty, Barns and garners never empty, Vines and clustering bunches growing, Plants with goodly burthen bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest! Scarcity and want shall shun you; Ceres' blessing so is on you. FERDINAND This is a most majestic vision, and Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold To think these spirits? PROSPERO Spirits, which by mine art I have from their confines call'd to enact My present fancies. FERDINAND Let me live here ever; So rare a wonder'd father and a wife Makes this place Paradise. Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment  PROSPERO Sweet, now, silence! Juno and Ceres whisper seriously; There's something else to do: hush, and be mute, Or else our spell is marr'd. IRIS You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks, With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels and on this green land Answer your summons; Juno does command: Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love; be not too late. Enter certain Nymphs  You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow and be merry: Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing. Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish  PROSPERO [Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates Against my life: the minute of their plot Is almost come. To the Spirits  Well done! avoid; no more! FERDINAND This is strange: your father's in some passion That works him strongly. MIRANDA Never till this day Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd. PROSPERO You do look, my son, in a moved sort, As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir. Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd; Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled: Be not disturb'd with my infirmity: If you be pleased, retire into my cell And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk, To still my beating mind. FERDINAND MIRANDA We wish your peace. Exeunt  PROSPERO Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come. Enter ARIEL  ARIEL Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure? PROSPERO Spirit, We must prepare to meet with Caliban. ARIEL Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres, I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd Lest I might anger thee. PROSPERO Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets? ARIEL I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking; So fun of valour that they smote the air For breathing in their faces; beat the ground For kissing of their feet; yet always bending Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour; At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears, Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns, Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet. PROSPERO This was well done, my bird. Thy shape invisible retain thou still: The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither, For stale to catch these thieves. ARIEL I go, I go. Exit  PROSPERO A devil, a born devil, on whose nature Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost; And as with age his body uglier grows, So his mind cankers. I will plague them all, Even to roaring. Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, & c  Come, hang them on this line. PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet  CALIBAN Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell. STEPHANO Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than played the Jack with us. TRINCULO Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at which my nose is in great indignation. STEPHANO So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you, look you,-- TRINCULO Thou wert but a lost monster. CALIBAN Good my lord, give me thy favour still. Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly. All's hush'd as midnight yet. TRINCULO Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,-- STEPHANO There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss. TRINCULO That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy, monster. STEPHANO I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour. CALIBAN Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here, This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter. Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot-licker. STEPHANO Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts. TRINCULO O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look what a wardrobe here is for thee! CALIBAN Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash. TRINCULO O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery. O king Stephano! STEPHANO Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have that gown. TRINCULO Thy grace shall have it. CALIBAN The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone And do the murder first: if he awake, From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff. STEPHANO Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin. TRINCULO Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace. STEPHANO I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't: wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent pass of pate; there's another garment for't. TRINCULO Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest. CALIBAN I will have none on't: we shall lose our time, And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes With foreheads villanous low. STEPHANO Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you out of my kingdom: go to, carry this. TRINCULO And this. STEPHANO Ay, and this. A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on  PROSPERO Hey, Mountain, hey! ARIEL Silver I there it goes, Silver! PROSPERO Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark! CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out  Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them Than pard or cat o' mountain. ARIEL Hark, they roar! PROSPERO Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies: Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little Follow, and do me service. Exeunt  ACT V SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell. Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL PROSPERO Now does my project gather to a head: My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day? ARIEL On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease. PROSPERO I did say so, When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit, How fares the king and's followers? ARIEL Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell; They cannot budge till your release. The king, His brother and yours, abide all three distracted And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;' His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. PROSPERO Dost thou think so, spirit? ARIEL Mine would, sir, were I human. PROSPERO And mine shall. Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply, Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick, Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury Do I take part: the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel: My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore, And they shall be themselves. ARIEL I'll fetch them, sir. Exit  PROSPERO Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves, And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him When he comes back; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid, Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds, And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up The pine and cedar: graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic I here abjure, and, when I have required Some heavenly music, which even now I do, To work mine end upon their senses that This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, And deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll drown my book. Solemn music  Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:  A solemn air and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand, For you are spell-stopp'd. Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace, And as the morning steals upon the night, Melting the darkness, so their rising senses Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo, My true preserver, and a loyal sir To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition, Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian, Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong, Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding Begins to swell, and the approaching tide Will shortly fill the reasonable shore That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel, Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell: I will discase me, and myself present As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit; Thou shalt ere long be free. ARIEL sings and helps to attire him  Where the bee sucks. there suck I: In a cowslip's bell I lie; There I couch when owls do cry. On the bat's back I do fly After summer merrily. Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. PROSPERO Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee: But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so. To the king's ship, invisible as thou art: There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain Being awake, enforce them to this place, And presently, I prithee. ARIEL I drink the air before me, and return Or ere your pulse twice beat. Exit  GONZALO All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us Out of this fearful country! PROSPERO Behold, sir king, The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero: For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body; And to thee and thy company I bid A hearty welcome. ALONSO Whether thou best he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me, As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee, The affliction of my mind amends, with which, I fear, a madness held me: this must crave, An if this be at all, a most strange story. Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero Be living and be here? PROSPERO First, noble friend, Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot Be measured or confined. GONZALO Whether this be Or be not, I'll not swear. PROSPERO You do yet taste Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all! Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO  But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you And justify you traitors: at this time I will tell no tales. SEBASTIAN [Aside] The devil speaks in him. PROSPERO No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, Thou must restore. ALONSO If thou be'st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-- My dear son Ferdinand. PROSPERO I am woe for't, sir. ALONSO Irreparable is the loss, and patience Says it is past her cure. PROSPERO I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content. ALONSO You the like loss! PROSPERO As great to me as late; and, supportable To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. ALONSO A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there! that they were, I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter? PROSPERO In this last tempest. I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed, To be the lord on't. No more yet of this; For 'tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast nor Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir; This cell's my court: here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in. My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing; At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye As much as me my dukedom. Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess  MIRANDA Sweet lord, you play me false. FERDINAND No, my dear'st love, I would not for the world. MIRANDA Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it, fair play. ALONSO If this prove A vision of the Island, one dear son Shall I twice lose. SEBASTIAN A most high miracle! FERDINAND Though the seas threaten, they are merciful; I have cursed them without cause. Kneels  ALONSO Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! Arise, and say how thou camest here. MIRANDA O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in't! PROSPERO 'Tis new to thee. ALONSO What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours: Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us, And brought us thus together? FERDINAND Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal Providence she's mine: I chose her when I could not ask my father For his advice, nor thought I had one. She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before; of whom I have Received a second life; and second father This lady makes him to me. ALONSO I am hers: But, O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness! PROSPERO There, sir, stop: Let us not burthen our remembrance with A heaviness that's gone. GONZALO I have inly wept, Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god, And on this couple drop a blessed crown! For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way Which brought us hither. ALONSO I say, Amen, Gonzalo! GONZALO Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy, and set it down With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle and all of us ourselves When no man was his own. ALONSO [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands: Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy! GONZALO Be it so! Amen! Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following  O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us: I prophesied, if a gallows were on land, This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy, That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore? Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news? Boatswain The best news is, that we have safely found Our king and company; the next, our ship-- Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split-- Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when We first put out to sea. ARIEL [Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service Have I done since I went. PROSPERO [Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit! ALONSO These are not natural events; they strengthen From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither? Boatswain If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep, And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches; Where but even now with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, And more diversity of sounds, all horrible, We were awaked; straightway, at liberty; Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you, Even in a dream, were we divided from them And were brought moping hither. ARIEL [Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done? PROSPERO [Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free. ALONSO This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of: some oracle Must rectify our knowledge. PROSPERO Sir, my liege, Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you, Which to you shall seem probable, of every These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful And think of each thing well. Aside to ARIEL  Come hither, spirit: Set Caliban and his companions free; Untie the spell. Exit ARIEL  How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel  STEPHANO Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! TRINCULO If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here's a goodly sight. CALIBAN O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. SEBASTIAN Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy 'em? ANTONIO Very like; one of them Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. PROSPERO Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch, and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, And deal in her command without her power. These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil-- For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness! Acknowledge mine. CALIBAN I shall be pinch'd to death. ALONSO Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? SEBASTIAN He is drunk now: where had he wine? ALONSO And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em? How camest thou in this pickle? TRINCULO I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing. SEBASTIAN Why, how now, Stephano! STEPHANO O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp. PROSPERO You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah? STEPHANO I should have been a sore one then. ALONSO This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on. Pointing to Caliban  PROSPERO He is as disproportion'd in his manners As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell; Take with you your companions; as you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely. CALIBAN Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass Was I, to take this drunkard for a god And worship this dull fool! PROSPERO Go to; away! ALONSO Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it. SEBASTIAN Or stole it, rather. Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO  PROSPERO Sir, I invite your highness and your train To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it Go quick away; the story of my life And the particular accidents gone by Since I came to this isle: and in the morn I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples, Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-beloved solemnized; And thence retire me to my Milan, where Every third thought shall be my grave. ALONSO I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely. PROSPERO I'll deliver all; And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales And sail so expeditious that shall catch Your royal fleet far off. Aside to ARIEL  My Ariel, chick, That is thy charge: then to the elements Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near. Exeunt  EPILOGUE SPOKEN BY PROSPERO Now my charms are all o'erthrown, And what strength I have's mine own, Which is most faint: now, 'tis true, I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples. Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell; But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands: Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please. Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardon'd be, Let your indulgence set me free.  1606 THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH   by William Shakespeare    Dramatis Personae    DUNCAN, King of Scotland   MACBETH, Thane of Glamis and Cawdor, a general in the King's army   LADY MACBETH, his wife   MACDUFF, Thane of Fife, a nobleman of Scotland   LADY MACDUFF, his wife   MALCOLM, elder son of Duncan   DONALBAIN, younger son of Duncan   BANQUO, Thane of Lochaber, a general in the King's army   FLEANCE, his son   LENNOX, nobleman of Scotland   ROSS, nobleman of Scotland   MENTEITH nobleman of Scotland   ANGUS, nobleman of Scotland   CAITHNESS, nobleman of Scotland   SIWARD, Earl of Northumberland, general of the English forces   YOUNG SIWARD, his son   SEYTON, attendant to Macbeth   HECATE, Queen of the Witches   The Three Witches   Boy, Son of Macduff    Gentlewoman attending on Lady Macbeth   An English Doctor   A Scottish Doctor   A Sergeant   A Porter   An Old Man   The Ghost of Banquo and other Apparitions   Lords, Gentlemen, Officers, Soldiers, Murtherers, Attendants,      and Messengers     <<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY WITH PERMISSION.

Enter three Witches.    FIRST WITCH. When shall we three meet again?     In thunder, lightning, or in rain?   SECOND WITCH. When the hurlyburly's done,     When the battle's lost and won.   THIRD WITCH. That will be ere the set of sun.   FIRST WITCH. Where the place?   SECOND WITCH. Upon the heath.   THIRD WITCH. There to meet with Macbeth.   FIRST WITCH. I come, Graymalkin.   ALL. Paddock calls. Anon!     Fair is foul, and foul is fair.     Hover through the fog and filthy air.                Exeunt.     SCENE II. A camp near Forres. Alarum within.  Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant.    DUNCAN. What bloody man is that? He can report,     As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt     The newest state.   MALCOLM. This is the sergeant     Who like a good and hardy soldier fought     'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!     Say to the King the knowledge of the broil     As thou didst leave it.   SERGEANT. Doubtful it stood,     As two spent swimmers that do cling together     And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-     Worthy to be a rebel, for to that     The multiplying villainies of nature     Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles     Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;     And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,      Show'd like a rebel's whore. But all's too weak;     For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name-     Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish'd steel,     Which smoked with bloody execution,     Like Valor's minion carved out his passage     Till he faced the slave,     Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,     Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,     And fix'd his head upon our battlements.   DUNCAN. O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!   SERGEANT. As whence the sun 'gins his reflection     Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,     So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come     Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark.     No sooner justice had, with valor arm'd,     Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,     But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,     With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men,     Began a fresh assault.   DUNCAN. Dismay'd not this      Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo.?   SERGEANT. Yes,     As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.     If I say sooth, I must report they were     As cannons overcharged with double cracks,     So they     Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.     Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,     Or memorize another Golgotha,     I cannot tell-     But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.   DUNCAN. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;     They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons.                                         Exit Sergeant, attended.     Who comes here?                         Enter Ross.    MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross.   LENNOX. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look      That seems to speak things strange.   ROSS. God save the King!   DUNCAN. Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?   ROSS. From Fife, great King,     Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky     And fan our people cold.     Norway himself, with terrible numbers,     Assisted by that most disloyal traitor     The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,     Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,     Confronted him with self-comparisons,     Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,     Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,     The victory fell on us.   DUNCAN. Great happiness!   ROSS. That now     Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;     Nor would we deign him burial of his men     Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme's Inch,     Ten thousand dollars to our general use.    DUNCAN. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive     Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,     And with his former title greet Macbeth.   ROSS. I'll see it done.   DUNCAN. What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE III. A heath. Thunder.  Enter the three Witches.    FIRST WITCH. Where hast thou been, sister?   SECOND WITCH. Killing swine.   THIRD WITCH. Sister, where thou?   FIRST WITCH. A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,     And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd. "Give me," quoth I.     "Aroint thee, witch!" the rump-fed ronyon cries.     Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;     But in a sieve I'll thither sail,     And, like a rat without a tail,     I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.   SECOND WITCH. I'll give thee a wind.   FIRST WITCH. Thou'rt kind.   THIRD WITCH. And I another.   FIRST WITCH. I myself have all the other,     And the very ports they blow,     All the quarters that they know     I' the shipman's card.      I will drain him dry as hay:     Sleep shall neither night nor day     Hang upon his penthouse lid;     He shall live a man forbid.     Weary se'nnights nine times nine     Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;     Though his bark cannot be lost,     Yet it shall be tempest-toss'd.     Look what I have.   SECOND WITCH. Show me, show me.   FIRST WITCH. Here I have a pilot's thumb,     Wreck'd as homeward he did come.                Drum within.   THIRD WITCH. A drum, a drum!     Macbeth doth come.   ALL. The weird sisters, hand in hand,     Posters of the sea and land,     Thus do go about, about,     Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,     And thrice again, to make up nine.     Peace! The charm's wound up.                    Enter Macbeth and Banquo.    MACBETH. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.   BANQUO. How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these     So wither'd and so wild in their attire,     That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,     And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught     That man may question? You seem to understand me,     By each at once her choppy finger laying     Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,     And yet your beards forbid me to interpret     That you are so.   MACBETH. Speak, if you can. What are you?   FIRST WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!   SECOND WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!   THIRD WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!   BANQUO. Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear     Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,     Are ye fantastical or that indeed      Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner     You greet with present grace and great prediction     Of noble having and of royal hope,     That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.     If you can look into the seeds of time,     And say which grain will grow and which will not,     Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear     Your favors nor your hate.   FIRST WITCH. Hail!   SECOND WITCH. Hail!   THIRD WITCH. Hail!   FIRST WITCH. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.   SECOND WITCH. Not so happy, yet much happier.   THIRD WITCH. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.     So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!   FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!   MACBETH. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.     By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis;     But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,     A prosperous gentleman; and to be King      Stands not within the prospect of belief,     No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence     You owe this strange intelligence, or why     Upon this blasted heath you stop our way     With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.                                                  Witches vanish.   BANQUO. The earth hath bubbles as the water has,     And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?   MACBETH. Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted     As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!   BANQUO. Were such things here as we do speak about?     Or have we eaten on the insane root     That takes the reason prisoner?   MACBETH. Your children shall be kings.   BANQUO. You shall be King.   MACBETH. And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?   BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?                  Enter Ross and Angus.     ROSS. The King hath happily received, Macbeth,     The news of thy success; and when he reads     Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,     His wonders and his praises do contend     Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,     In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,     He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,     Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,     Strange images of death. As thick as hail     Came post with post, and every one did bear     Thy praises in his kingdom's great defense,     And pour'd them down before him.   ANGUS. We are sent     To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;     Only to herald thee into his sight,     Not pay thee.   ROSS. And for an earnest of a greater honor,     He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.     In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,     For it is thine.    BANQUO. What, can the devil speak true?   MACBETH. The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me     In borrow'd robes?   ANGUS. Who was the Thane lives yet,     But under heavy judgement bears that life     Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined     With those of Norway, or did line the rebel     With hidden help and vantage, or that with both     He labor'd in his country's wreck, I know not;     But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,     Have overthrown him.   MACBETH. [Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!     The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus] Thanks for your       pains.     [Aside to Banquo] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,     When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me     Promised no less to them?   BANQUO. [Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,     Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,     Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange;      And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,     The instruments of darkness tell us truths,     Win us with honest trifles, to betray's     In deepest consequence-     Cousins, a word, I pray you.   MACBETH. [Aside.] Two truths are told,     As happy prologues to the swelling act     Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen.     [Aside.] This supernatural soliciting     Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,     Why hath it given me earnest of success,     Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.     If good, why do I yield to that suggestion     Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair     And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,     Against the use of nature? Present fears     Are less than horrible imaginings:     My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,     Shakes so my single state of man that function     Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is      But what is not.   BANQUO. Look, how our partner's rapt.   MACBETH. [Aside.] If chance will have me King, why, chance may       crown me     Without my stir.   BANQUO. New honors come upon him,     Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould     But with the aid of use.   MACBETH. [Aside.] Come what come may,     Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.   BANQUO. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.   MACBETH. Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought     With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains     Are register'd where every day I turn     The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.     Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time,     The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak     Our free hearts each to other.   BANQUO. Very gladly.   MACBETH. Till then, enough. Come, friends.             Exeunt.     SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.  Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, and Attendants.    DUNCAN. Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not     Those in commission yet return'd?   MALCOLM. My liege,     They are not yet come back. But I have spoke     With one that saw him die, who did report     That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,     Implored your Highness' pardon, and set forth     A deep repentance. Nothing in his life     Became him like the leaving it; he died     As one that had been studied in his death,     To throw away the dearest thing he owed     As 'twere a careless trifle.   DUNCAN. There's no art     To find the mind's construction in the face:     He was a gentleman on whom I built     An absolute trust.                Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.      O worthiest cousin!     The sin of my ingratitude even now     Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,     That swiftest wing of recompense is slow     To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,     That the proportion both of thanks and payment     Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,     More is thy due than more than all can pay.   MACBETH. The service and the loyalty lowe,     In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness' part     Is to receive our duties, and our duties     Are to your throne and state, children and servants,     Which do but what they should, by doing everything     Safe toward your love and honor.   DUNCAN. Welcome hither.     I have begun to plant thee, and will labor     To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,      That hast no less deserved, nor must be known     No less to have done so; let me infold thee     And hold thee to my heart.   BANQUO. There if I grow,     The harvest is your own.   DUNCAN. My plenteous joys,     Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves     In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,     And you whose places are the nearest, know     We will establish our estate upon     Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter     The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must     Not unaccompanied invest him only,     But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine     On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,     And bind us further to you.   MACBETH. The rest is labor, which is not used for you.     I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful     The hearing of my wife with your approach;     So humbly take my leave.    DUNCAN. My worthy Cawdor!   MACBETH. [Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step     On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,     For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;     Let not light see my black and deep desires.     The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be     Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.          Exit.   DUNCAN. True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant,     And in his commendations I am fed;     It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,     Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.     It is a peerless kinsman.                  Flourish. Exeunt.     SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.  Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.    LADY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have     learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than     mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them     further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.     Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the     King, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor'; by which title,     before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the     coming on of time with 'Hail, King that shalt be!' This have I     thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,     that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being     ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart,     and farewell."      Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be     What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.     It is too full o' the milk of human kindness     To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;      Art not without ambition, but without     The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,     That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,     And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,     That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;     And that which rather thou dost fear to do     Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,     That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,     And chastise with the valor of my tongue     All that impedes thee from the golden round,     Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem     To have thee crown'd withal.                       Enter a Messenger.      What is your tidings?   MESSENGER. The King comes here tonight.   LADY MACBETH. Thou'rt mad to say it!     Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,     Would have inform'd for preparation.    MESSENGER. So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.     One of my fellows had the speed of him,     Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more     Than would make up his message.   LADY MACBETH. Give him tending;     He brings great news.                        Exit Messenger.     The raven himself is hoarse     That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan     Under my battlements. Come, you spirits     That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here     And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full     Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,     Stop up the access and passage to remorse,     That no compunctious visitings of nature     Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between     The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,     And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,     Wherever in your sightless substances     You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,     And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell      That my keen knife see not the wound it makes     Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark     To cry, "Hold, hold!"                      Enter Macbeth.      Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor!     Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!     Thy letters have transported me beyond     This ignorant present, and I feel now     The future in the instant.   MACBETH. My dearest love,     Duncan comes here tonight.   LADY MACBETH. And when goes hence?   MACBETH. Tomorrow, as he purposes.   LADY MACBETH. O, never     Shall sun that morrow see!     Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men     May read strange matters. To beguile the time,     Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,      Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,     But be the serpent under it. He that's coming     Must be provided for; and you shall put     This night's great business into my dispatch,     Which shall to all our nights and days to come     Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.   MACBETH. We will speak further.   LADY MACBETH. Only look up clear;     To alter favor ever is to fear.     Leave all the rest to me.                            Exeunt.     SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.  Hautboys and torches.  Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus, and Attendants.    DUNCAN. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air     Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself     Unto our gentle senses.   BANQUO. This guest of summer,     The temple-haunting martlet, does approve     By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath     Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,     Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird     Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;     Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed     The air is delicate.                       Enter Lady Macbeth.    DUNCAN. See, see, our honor'd hostess!     The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,      Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you     How you shall bid God 'ield us for your pains,     And thank us for your trouble.   LADY MACBETH. All our service     In every point twice done, and then done double,     Were poor and single business to contend     Against those honors deep and broad wherewith     Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,     And the late dignities heap'd up to them,     We rest your hermits.   DUNCAN. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?     We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose     To be his purveyor; but he rides well,     And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him     To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,     We are your guest tonight.   LADY MACBETH. Your servants ever     Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,     To make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,     Still to return your own.    DUNCAN. Give me your hand;     Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly,     And shall continue our graces towards him.     By your leave, hostess.                              Exeunt.     SCENE VII Macbeth's castle.  Hautboys and torches.  Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service, who pass over the stage.  Then enter Macbeth.    MACBETH. If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well     It were done quickly. If the assassination     Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,     With his surcease, success; that but this blow     Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,     But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,     We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases     We still have judgement here, that we but teach     Bloody instructions, which being taught return     To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice     Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice     To our own lips. He's here in double trust:     First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,     Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,     Who should against his murtherer shut the door,      Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan     Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been     So clear in his great office, that his virtues     Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against     The deep damnation of his taking-off,     And pity, like a naked new-born babe     Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed     Upon the sightless couriers of the air,     Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,     That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur     To prick the sides of my intent, but only     Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself     And falls on the other.                   Enter Lady Macbeth.      How now, what news?   LADY MACBETH. He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber?   MACBETH. Hath he ask'd for me?   LADY MACBETH. Know you not he has?    MACBETH. We will proceed no further in this business:     He hath honor'd me of late, and I have bought     Golden opinions from all sorts of people,     Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,     Not cast aside so soon.   LADY MACBETH. Was the hope drunk     Wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since?     And wakes it now, to look so green and pale     At what it did so freely? From this time     Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard     To be the same in thine own act and valor     As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that     Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life     And live a coward in thine own esteem,     Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"     Like the poor cat i' the adage?   MACBETH. Prithee, peace!     I dare do all that may become a man;     Who dares do more is none.   LADY MACBETH. What beast wast then      That made you break this enterprise to me?     When you durst do it, then you were a man,     And, to be more than what you were, you would     Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place     Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.     They have made themselves, and that their fitness now     Does unmake you. I have given suck and know     How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me-     I would, while it was smiling in my face,     Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums     And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you     Have done to this.   MACBETH. If we should fail?   LADY MACBETH. We fail?     But screw your courage to the sticking-place     And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-     Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey     Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains     Will I with wine and wassail so convince     That memory, the warder of the brain,      Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason     A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep     Their drenched natures lie as in a death,     What cannot you and I perform upon     The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon     His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt     Of our great quell?   MACBETH. Bring forth men-children only,     For thy undaunted mettle should compose     Nothing but males. Will it not be received,     When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two     Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,     That they have done't?   LADY MACBETH. Who dares receive it other,     As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar     Upon his death?   MACBETH. I am settled and bend up     Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.     Away, and mock the time with fairest show:     False face must hide what the false heart doth know.                                                           Exeunt.     <<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY WITH PERMISSION.

Enter Banquo and Fleance, bearing a torch before him.    BANQUO. How goes the night, boy?   FLEANCE. The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.   BANQUO. And she goes down at twelve.   FLEANCE. I take't 'tis later, sir.   BANQUO. Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven,     Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.     A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,     And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,     Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature     Gives way to in repose!             Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.      Give me my sword.     Who's there?   MACBETH. A friend.   BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed.      He hath been in unusual pleasure and     Sent forth great largess to your offices.     This diamond he greets your wife withal,     By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up     In measureless content.   MACBETH. Being unprepared,     Our will became the servant to defect,     Which else should free have wrought.   BANQUO. All's well.     I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:     To you they have show'd some truth.   MACBETH. I think not of them;     Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,     We would spend it in some words upon that business,     If you would grant the time.   BANQUO. At your kind'st leisure.   MACBETH. If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,     It shall make honor for you.   BANQUO. So I lose none     In seeking to augment it, but still keep      My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,     I shall be counsel'd.   MACBETH. Good repose the while.   BANQUO. Thanks, sir, the like to you.                                      Exeunt Banquo. and Fleance.   MACBETH. Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,     She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.     Exit Servant.     Is this a dagger which I see before me,     The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.     I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.     Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible     To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but     A dagger of the mind, a false creation,     Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?     I see thee yet, in form as palpable     As this which now I draw.     Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going,     And such an instrument I was to use.     Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,     Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still,      And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,     Which was not so before. There's no such thing:     It is the bloody business which informs     Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world     Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse     The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates     Pale Hecate's offerings; and wither'd Murther,     Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,     Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,     With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design     Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,     Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear     Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,     And take the present horror from the time,     Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives;     Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.                                                    A bell rings.     I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.     Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell     That summons thee to heaven, or to hell.               Exit.     SCENE II. The same.  Enter Lady Macbeth.    LADY MACBETH. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;     What hath quench'd them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!     It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,     Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it:     The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms     Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg'd their possets     That death and nature do contend about them,     Whether they live or die.   MACBETH. [Within.] Who's there' what, ho!   LADY MACBETH. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked     And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed     Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;     He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled     My father as he slept, I had done't.                        Enter Macbeth,       My husband!   MACBETH. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?   LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.     Did not you speak?   MACBETH. When?   LADY MACBETH. Now.   MACBETH. As I descended?   LADY MACBETH. Ay.   MACBETH. Hark!     Who lies i' the second chamber?   LADY MACBETH. Donalbain.   MACBETH. This is a sorry sight.           [Looks on his hands.   LADY MACBETH. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.   MACBETH. There's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried,       "Murther!"     That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them,     But they did say their prayers and address'd them     Again to sleep.   LADY MACBETH. There are two lodged together.   MACBETH. One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other,      As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.     Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen,"     When they did say, "God bless us!"   LADY MACBETH. Consider it not so deeply.   MACBETH. But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?     I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"     Stuck in my throat.   LADY MACBETH. These deeds must not be thought     After these ways; so, it will make us mad.   MACBETH. I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!     Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,     Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care,     The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,     Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,     Chief nourisher in life's feast-   LADY MACBETH. What do you mean?   MACBETH. Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house;     "Glamis hath murther'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor     Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more."   LADY MACBETH. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy Thane,      You do unbend your noble strength, to think     So brainsickly of things. Go, get some water     And wash this filthy witness from your hand.     Why did you bring these daggers from the place?     They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear     The sleepy grooms with blood.   MACBETH. I'll go no more.     I am afraid to think what I have done;     Look on't again I dare not.   LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose!     Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead     Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood     That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,     I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,     For it must seem their guilt.         Exit. Knocking within.   MACBETH. Whence is that knocking?     How is't with me, when every noise appals me?     What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!     Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood     Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather      The multitudinous seas incarnadine,     Making the green one red.                     Re-enter Lady Macbeth.    LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame     To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear knocking     At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.     A little water clears us of this deed.     How easy is it then! Your constancy     Hath left you unattended. [Knocking within.] Hark, more knocking.     Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us     And show us to be watchers. Be not lost     So poorly in your thoughts.   MACBETH. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.                                                 Knocking within.     Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE III. The same.  Enter a Porter. Knocking within.    PORTER. Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of Hell     Gate, he should have old turning the key. [Knocking within.]     Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub? Here's     a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty. Come     in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you'll sweat fort.     [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th' other     devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in     both the scales against either scale, who committed treason     enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O,     come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock!     Who's there? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither, for     stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may     roast your goose. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at     quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell. I'll     devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some of     all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting     bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the      porter.                                                  Opens the gate.                         Enter Macduff and Lennox.    MACDUFF. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,     That you do lie so late?   PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and     drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.   MACDUFF. What three things does drink especially provoke?   PORTER. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir,     it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes     away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an     equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets     him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens     him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion,     equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.   MACDUFF. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.   PORTER. That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited     him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though      he took up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.   MACDUFF. Is thy master stirring?                               Enter Macbeth.      Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.   LENNOX. Good morrow, noble sir.   MACBETH. morrow, both.   MACDUFF. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?   MACBETH. Not yet.   MACDUFF. He did command me to call timely on him;     I have almost slipp'd the hour.   MACBETH. I'll bring you to him.   MACDUFF. I know this is a joyful trouble to you,     But yet 'tis one.   MACBETH. The labor we delight in physics pain.     This is the door.   MACDUFF I'll make so bold to call,     For 'tis my limited service.                           Exit.   LENNOX. Goes the King hence today?    MACBETH. He does; he did appoint so.   LENNOX. The night has been unruly. Where we lay,     Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,     Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,     And prophesying with accents terrible     Of dire combustion and confused events     New hatch'd to the woeful time. The obscure bird     Clamor'd the livelong night. Some say the earth     Was feverous and did shake.   MACBETH. 'Twas a rough fight.   LENNOX. My young remembrance cannot parallel     A fellow to it.                        Re-enter Macduff.    MACDUFF. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart     Cannot conceive nor name thee.   MACBETH. LENNOX. What's the matter?   MACDUFF. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.     Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope      The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence     The life o' the building.   MACBETH. What is't you say? the life?   LENNOX. Mean you his Majesty?   MACDUFF. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight     With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak;     See, and then speak yourselves.                                       Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.     Awake, awake!     Ring the alarum bell. Murther and treason!     Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm, awake!     Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,     And look on death itself! Up, up, and see     The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!     As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites     To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.       Bell rings.                       Enter Lady Macbeth.    LADY MACBETH. What's the business,      That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley     The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!   MACDUFF. O gentle lady,     'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:     The repetition in a woman's ear     Would murther as it fell.                       Enter Banquo.      O Banquo, Banquo!     Our royal master's murther'd.   LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas!     What, in our house?   BANQUO. Too cruel anywhere.     Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,     And say it is not so.            Re-enter Macbeth and Lennox, with Ross.    MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance,      I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant     There's nothing serious in mortality.     All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,     The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees     Is left this vault to brag of.                  Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.    DONALBAIN. What is amiss?   MACBETH. You are, and do not know't.     The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood     Is stopped, the very source of it is stopp'd.   MACDUFF. Your royal father's murther'd.    MALCOLM. O, by whom?   LENNOX. Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done't.     Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;     So were their daggers, which unwiped we found     Upon their pillows.     They stared, and were distracted; no man's life     Was to be trusted with them.    MACBETH. O, yet I do repent me of my fury,     That I did kill them.   MACDUFF. Wherefore did you so?   MACBETH. Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,     Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man.     The expedition of my violent love     Outrun the pauser reason. Here lay Duncan,     His silver skin laced with his golden blood,     And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature     For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers,     Steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers     Unmannerly breech'd with gore. Who could refrain,     That had a heart to love, and in that heart     Courage to make 's love known?   LADY MACBETH. Help me hence, ho!   MACDUFF. Look to the lady.   MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Why do we hold our tongues,     That most may claim this argument for ours?   DONALBAIN. [Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here, where       our fate,      Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?     Let's away,     Our tears are not yet brew'd.   MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Nor our strong sorrow     Upon the foot of motion.   BANQUO. Look to the lady.                                     Lady Macbeth is carried out.     And when we have our naked frailties hid,     That suffer in exposure, let us meet     And question this most bloody piece of work     To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.     In the great hand of God I stand, and thence     Against the undivulged pretense I fight     Of treasonous malice.   MACDUFF. And so do I.   ALL. So all.   MACBETH. Let's briefly put on manly readiness     And meet i' the hall together.   ALL. Well contented.                            Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.    MALCOLM. What will you do? Let's not consort with them.     To show an unfelt sorrow is an office     Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.   DONALBAIN. To Ireland, I; our separated fortune     Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are     There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood,     The nearer bloody.   MALCOLM. This murtherous shaft that's shot     Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way     Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;     And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,     But shift away. There's warrant in that theft     Which steals itself when there's no mercy left.                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.  Enter Ross with an Old Man.    OLD MAN. Threescore and ten I can remember well,     Within the volume of which time I have seen     Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night     Hath trifled former knowings.   ROSS. Ah, good father,     Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,     Threaten his bloody stage. By the clock 'tis day,     And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.     Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,     That darkness does the face of earth entomb,     When living light should kiss it?   OLD MAN. 'Tis unnatural,     Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last     A falcon towering in her pride of place     Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.   ROSS. And Duncan's horses-a thing most strange and certain-     Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,      Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,     Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make     War with mankind.   OLD MAN. 'Tis said they eat each other.   ROSS. They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes     That look'd upon't.                       Enter Macduff.      Here comes the good Macduff.     How goes the world, sir, now?   MACDUFF. Why, see you not?   ROSS. Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?   MACDUFF. Those that Macbeth hath slain.   ROSS. Alas, the day!     What good could they pretend?   MACDUFF. They were suborn'd:     Malcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,     Are stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them     Suspicion of the deed.    ROSS. 'Gainst nature still!     Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up     Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like     The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.   MACDUFF. He is already named, and gone to Scone     To be invested.   ROSS. Where is Duncan's body?   MACDUFF. Carried to Colmekill,     The sacred storehouse of his predecessors     And guardian of their bones.   ROSS. Will you to Scone?   MACDUFF. No, cousin, I'll to Fife.   ROSS. Well, I will thither.   MACDUFF. Well, may you see things well done there.     Adieu,     Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!   ROSS. Farewell, father.   OLD MAN. God's benison go with you and with those     That would make good of bad and friends of foes!                                                          Exeunt.     <<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY WITH PERMISSION.

Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,     As the weird women promised, and I fear     Thou play'dst most foully for't; yet it was said     It should not stand in thy posterity,     But that myself should be the root and father     Of many kings. If there come truth from them     (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)     Why, by the verities on thee made good,     May they not be my oracles as well     And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.        Sennet sounds. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth     as Queen, Lennox, Ross, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.    MACBETH. Here's our chief guest.   LADY MACBETH. If he had been forgotten,     It had been as a gap in our great feast      And all thing unbecoming.   MACBETH. Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,     And I'll request your presence.   BANQUO. Let your Highness     Command upon me, to the which my duties     Are with a most indissoluble tie     Forever knit.   MACBETH. Ride you this afternoon?   BANQUO. Ay, my good lord.   MACBETH. We should have else desired your good advice,     Which still hath been both grave and prosperous     In this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.     Is't far you ride'!   BANQUO. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time     'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,     I must become a borrower of the night     For a dark hour or twain.   MACBETH. Fail not our feast.   BANQUO. My lord, I will not.   MACBETH. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd      In England and in Ireland, not confessing     Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers     With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,     When therewithal we shall have cause of state     Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse; adieu,     Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?   BANQUO. Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon 's.   MACBETH. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot,     And so I do commend you to their backs.     Farewell.                                       Exit Banquo.     Let every man be master of his time     Till seven at night; to make society     The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself     Till supper time alone. While then, God be with you!                         Exeunt all but Macbeth and an Attendant.     Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men     Our pleasure?   ATTENDANT. They are, my lord, without the palace gate.   MACBETH. Bring them before us.                 Exit Attendant.     To be thus is nothing,      But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo.     Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature     Reigns that which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,     And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,     He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor     To act in safety. There is none but he     Whose being I do fear; and under him     My genius is rebuked, as it is said     Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters     When first they put the name of King upon me     And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like     They hail'd him father to a line of kings.     Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown     And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,     Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,     No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,     For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind,     For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd,     Put rancors in the vessel of my peace     Only for them, and mine eternal jewel      Given to the common enemy of man,     To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!     Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,     And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?          Re-enter Attendant, with two Murtherers.      Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.                                                  Exit Attendant.     Was it not yesterday we spoke together?   FIRST MURTHERER. It was, so please your Highness.   MACBETH. Well then, now     Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know     That it was he in the times past which held you     So under fortune, which you thought had been     Our innocent self? This I made good to you     In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you:     How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,     Who wrought with them, and all things else that might     To half a soul and to a notion crazed      Say, "Thus did Banquo."   FIRST MURTHERER. You made it known to us.   MACBETH. I did so, and went further, which is now     Our point of second meeting. Do you find     Your patience so predominant in your nature,     That you can let this go? Are you so gospel'd,     To pray for this good man and for his issue,     Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave     And beggar'd yours forever?   FIRST MURTHERER. We are men, my liege.   MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,     As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,     Shoughs, waterrugs, and demi-wolves are clept     All by the name of dogs. The valued file     Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,     The housekeeper, the hunter, every one     According to the gift which bounteous nature     Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive     Particular addition, from the bill     That writes them all alike; and so of men.      Now if you have a station in the file,     Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it,     And I will put that business in your bosoms     Whose execution takes your enemy off,     Grapples you to the heart and love of us,     Who wear our health but sickly in his life,     Which in his death were perfect.   SECOND MURTHERER. I am one, my liege,     Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world     Have so incensed that I am reckless what     I do to spite the world.   FIRST MURTHERER. And I another     So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,     That I would set my life on any chance,     To mend it or be rid on't.   MACBETH. Both of you     Know Banquo was your enemy.   BOTH MURTHERERS. True, my lord.   MACBETH. So is he mine, and in such bloody distance     That every minute of his being thrusts      Against my near'st of life; and though I could     With barefaced power sweep him from my sight     And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,     For certain friends that are both his and mine,     Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall     Who I myself struck down. And thence it is     That I to your assistance do make love,     Masking the business from the common eye     For sundry weighty reasons.   SECOND MURTHERER. We shall, my lord,     Perform what you command us.   FIRST MURTHERER. Though our lives-   MACBETH. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most     I will advise you where to plant yourselves,     Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,     The moment on't; fort must be done tonight     And something from the palace (always thought     That I require a clearness); and with him-     To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-     Fleance his son, that keeps him company,      Whose absence is no less material to me     Than is his father's, must embrace the fate     Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart;     I'll come to you anon.   BOTH MURTHERERS. We are resolved, my lord.   MACBETH. I'll call upon you straight. Abide within.                                               Exeunt Murtherers.     It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul's flight,     If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.           Exit.     SCENE II. The palace.  Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.    LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court?   SERVANT. Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.   LADY MACBETH. Say to the King I would attend his leisure     For a few words.   SERVANT. Madam, I will.                                  Exit.   LADY MACBETH. Nought's had, all's spent,     Where our desire is got without content.     'Tis safer to be that which we destroy     Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.                      Enter Macbeth.      How now, my lord? Why do you keep alone,     Of sorriest fancies your companions making,     Using those thoughts which should indeed have died     With them they think on? Things without all remedy     Should be without regard. What's done is done.    MACBETH. We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it.     She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice     Remains in danger of her former tooth.     But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,     Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep     In the affliction of these terrible dreams     That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,     Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,     Than on the torture of the mind to lie     In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;     After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.     Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,     Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,     Can touch him further.   LADY MACBETH. Come on,     Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;     Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.   MACBETH. So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.     Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;     Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:      Unsafe the while, that we     Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,     And make our faces vizards to our hearts,     Disguising what they are.   LADY MACBETH. You must leave this.   MACBETH. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!     Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.   LADY MACBETH. But in them nature's copy's not eterne.   MACBETH. There's comfort yet; they are assailable.     Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown     His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons     The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums     Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done     A deed of dreadful note.   LADY MACBETH. What's to be done?   MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,     Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,     Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,     And with thy bloody and invisible hand     Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond      Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow     Makes wing to the rooky wood;     Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,     Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.     Thou marvel'st at my words, but hold thee still:     Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.     So, prithee, go with me.                             Exeunt.     SCENE III. A park near the palace.  Enter three Murtherers.    FIRST MURTHERER. But who did bid thee join with us?   THIRD MURTHERER. Macbeth.   SECOND MURTHERER. He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers     Our offices and what we have to do     To the direction just.   FIRST MURTHERER. Then stand with us.     The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;     Now spurs the lated traveler apace     To gain the timely inn, and near approaches     The subject of our watch.   THIRD MURTHERER. Hark! I hear horses.   BANQUO. [Within.] Give us a light there, ho!   SECOND MURTHERER. Then 'tis he; the rest     That are within the note of expectation     Already are i' the court.   FIRST MURTHERER. His horses go about.   THIRD MURTHERER. Almost a mile, but he does usually-      So all men do -from hence to the palace gate     Make it their walk.   SECOND MURTHERER. A light, a light!                Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.    THIRD MURTHERER. 'Tis he.   FIRST MURTHERER. Stand to't.   BANQUO. It will be rain tonight.   FIRST MURTHERER. Let it come down.                                            They set upon Banquo.   BANQUO. O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!     Thou mayst revenge. O slave!          Dies. Fleance escapes.   THIRD MURTHERER. Who did strike out the light?   FIRST MURTHERER. Wast not the way?   THIRD MURTHERER. There's but one down; the son is fled.   SECOND MURTHERER. We have lost     Best half of our affair.   FIRST MURTHERER. Well, let's away and say how much is done.                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE IV. A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.  Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.    MACBETH. You know your own degrees; sit down. At first     And last the hearty welcome.   LORDS. Thanks to your Majesty.   MACBETH. Ourself will mingle with society     And play the humble host.     Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time     We will require her welcome.   LADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,     For my heart speaks they are welcome.                  Enter first Murtherer to the door.    MACBETH. See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.     Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst.     Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure     The table round. [Approaches the door.] There's blood upon thy        face.   MURTHERER. 'Tis Banquo's then.   MACBETH. 'Tis better thee without than he within.     Is he dispatch'd?   MURTHERER. My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.   MACBETH. Thou art the best o' the cut-throats! Yet he's good     That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it,     Thou art the nonpareil.   MURTHERER. Most royal sir,     Fleance is 'scaped.   MACBETH. [Aside.] Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,     Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,     As broad and general as the casing air;     But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd, bound in     To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo's safe?   MURTHERER. Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,     With twenty trenched gashes on his head,     The least a death to nature.   MACBETH. Thanks for that.     There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled      Hath nature that in time will venom breed,     No teeth for the present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow     We'll hear ourselves again.                                                  Exit Murtherer.   LADY MACBETH. My royal lord,     You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold     That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis amaking,     'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;     From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;     Meeting were bare without it.   MACBETH. Sweet remembrancer!     Now good digestion wait on appetite,     And health on both!   LENNOX. May't please your Highness sit.        The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place.    MACBETH. Here had we now our country's honor roof'd,     Were the graced person of our Banquo present,     Who may I rather challenge for unkindness      Than pity for mischance!   ROSS. His absence, sir,     Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your Highness     To grace us with your royal company?   MACBETH. The table's full.   LENNOX. Here is a place reserved, sir.   MACBETH. Where?   LENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your Highness?   MACBETH. Which of you have done this?   LORDS. What, my good lord?   MACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it; never shake     Thy gory locks at me.   ROSS. Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is well.   LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,     And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.     The fit is momentary; upon a thought     He will again be well. If much you note him,     You shall offend him and extend his passion.     Feed, and regard him not-Are you a man?   MACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that      Which might appal the devil.   LADY MACBETH. O proper stuff!     This is the very painting of your fear;     This is the air-drawn dagger which you said     Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,     Impostors to true fear, would well become     A woman's story at a winter's fire,     Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!     Why do you make such faces? When all's done,     You look but on a stool.   MACBETH. Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?     Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.     If charnel houses and our graves must send     Those that we bury back, our monuments     Shall be the maws of kites.                      Exit Ghost.   LADY MACBETH. What, quite unmann'd in folly?   MACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him.   LADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame!   MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,     Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;      Ay, and since too, murthers have been perform'd     Too terrible for the ear. The time has been,     That, when the brains were out, the man would die,     And there an end; but now they rise again,     With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,     And push us from our stools. This is more strange     Than such a murther is.   LADY MACBETH. My worthy lord,     Your noble friends do lack you.   MACBETH. I do forget.     Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.     I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing     To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;     Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine, fill full.     I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,     And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.     Would he were here! To all and him we thirst,     And all to all.   LORDS. Our duties and the pledge.                        Re-enter Ghost.    MACBETH. Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!     Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;     Thou hast no speculation in those eyes     Which thou dost glare with.   LADY MACBETH. Think of this, good peers,     But as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other,     Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.   MACBETH. What man dare, I dare.     Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,     The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;     Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves     Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,     And dare me to the desert with thy sword.     If trembling I inhabit then, protest me     The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!     Unreal mockery, hence!                           Exit Ghost.     Why, so, being gone,     I am a man again. Pray you sit still.    LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,     With most admired disorder.   MACBETH. Can such things be,     And overcome us like a summer's cloud,     Without our special wonder? You make me strange     Even to the disposition that I owe     When now I think you can behold such sights     And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks     When mine is blanch'd with fear.   ROSS. What sights, my lord?   LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;     Question enrages him. At once, good night.     Stand not upon the order of your going,     But go at once.   LENNOX. Good night, and better health     Attend his Majesty!   LADY MACBETH. A kind good night to all!                         Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.   MACBETH. will have blood; they say blood will have blood.     Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;      Augures and understood relations have     By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth     The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?   LADY MACBETH. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.   MACBETH. How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person     At our great bidding?   LADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir?   MACBETH. I hear it by the way, but I will send.     There's not a one of them but in his house     I keep a servant feed. I will tomorrow,     And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.     More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,     By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good     All causes shall give way. I am in blood     Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,     Returning were as tedious as go o'er.     Strange things I have in head that will to hand,     Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.   LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep.   MACBETH. Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse      Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.     We are yet but young in deed.                       Exeunt.     SCENE V. A heath. Thunder.  Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.    FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.   HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are,     Saucy and overbold? How did you dare     To trade and traffic with Macbeth     In riddles and affairs of death,     And I, the mistress of your charms,     The close contriver of all harms,     Was never call'd to bear my part,     Or show the glory of our art?     And, which is worse, all you have done     Hath been but for a wayward son,     Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,     Loves for his own ends, not for you.     But make amends now. Get you gone,     And at the pit of Acheron     Meet me i' the morning. Thither he     Will come to know his destiny.      Your vessels and your spells provide,     Your charms and everything beside.     I am for the air; this night I'll spend     Unto a dismal and a fatal end.     Great business must be wrought ere noon:     Upon the corner of the moon     There hangs a vaporous drop profound;     I'll catch it ere it come to ground.     And that distill'd by magic sleights     Shall raise such artificial sprites     As by the strength of their illusion     Shall draw him on to his confusion.     He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear     His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.     And you all know security     Is mortals' chiefest enemy.                                         Music and a song within,                                          "Come away, come away."     Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,     Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.                Exit.    FIRST WITCH. Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.  Enter Lennox and another Lord.    LENNOX. My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,     Which can interpret farther; only I say     Thing's have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan     Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.     And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,     Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,     For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.     Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous     It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain     To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!     How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight,     In pious rage, the two delinquents tear     That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?     Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,     For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive     To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,     He has borne all things well; and I do think      That, had he Duncan's sons under his key-     As, an't please heaven, he shall not -they should find     What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.     But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he fail'd     His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,     Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell     Where he bestows himself?   LORD. The son of Duncan,     From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,     Lives in the English court and is received     Of the most pious Edward with such grace     That the malevolence of fortune nothing     Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff     Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid     To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;     That by the help of these, with Him above     To ratify the work, we may again     Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,     Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,     Do faithful homage, and receive free honors-      All which we pine for now. And this report     Hath so exasperate the King that he     Prepares for some attempt of war.   LENNOX. Sent he to Macduff?   LORD. He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"     The cloudy messenger turns me his back,     And hums, as who should say, "You'll rue the time     That clogs me with this answer."   LENNOX. And that well might     Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance     His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel     Fly to the court of England and unfold     His message ere he come, that a swift blessing     May soon return to this our suffering country     Under a hand accursed!   LORD. I'll send my prayers with him.                                                          Exeunt.     <<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY WITH PERMISSION.

Enter the three Witches.   FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.   SECOND WITCH. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.   THIRD WITCH. Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time."   FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go;     In the poison'd entrails throw.     Toad, that under cold stone     Days and nights has thirty-one     Swelter'd venom sleeping got,     Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.   ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble;     Fire burn and cauldron bubble.   SECOND WITCH. Fillet of a fenny snake,     In the cauldron boil and bake;     Eye of newt and toe of frog,     Wool of bat and tongue of dog,     Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,     Lizard's leg and howlet's wing,     For a charm of powerful trouble,      Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.   ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble;     Fire burn and cauldron bubble.   THIRD WITCH. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,     Witch's mummy, maw and gulf     Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,     Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,     Liver of blaspheming Jew,     Gall of goat and slips of yew     Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse,     Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,     Finger of birth-strangled babe     Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,     Make the gruel thick and slab.     Add thereto a tiger's chawdron,     For the ingredients of our cawdron.   ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble;     Fire burn and cauldron bubble.   SECOND WITCH. Cool it with a baboon's blood,     Then the charm is firm and good.               Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.    HECATE. O, well done! I commend your pains,     And everyone shall share i' the gains.     And now about the cauldron sing,     Like elves and fairies in a ring,     Enchanting all that you put in.                               Music and a song, "Black spirits."                                                  Hecate retires.   SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs,     Something wicked this way comes.     Open, locks,     Whoever knocks!                        Enter Macbeth.    MACBETH. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?     What is't you do?   ALL. A deed without a name.    MACBETH. I conjure you, by that which you profess     (Howeer you come to know it) answer me:     Though you untie the winds and let them fight     Against the churches, though the yesty waves     Confound and swallow navigation up,     Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,     Though castles topple on their warders' heads,     Though palaces and pyramids do slope     Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure     Of nature's germaines tumble all together     Even till destruction sicken, answer me     To what I ask you.   FIRST WITCH. Speak.   SECOND WITCH. Demand.   THIRD WITCH. We'll answer.   FIRST WITCH. Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,     Or from our masters'?   MACBETH. Call 'em, let me see 'em.   FIRST WITCH. Pour in sow's blood that hath eaten     Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten      From the murtherer's gibbet throw     Into the flame.   ALL. Come, high or low;     Thyself and office deftly show!              Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head.    MACBETH. Tell me, thou unknown power-   FIRST WITCH. He knows thy thought:     Hear his speech, but say thou nought.   FIRST APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,     Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.                                                        Descends.   MACBETH. Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;     Thou hast harp'd my fear aright. But one word more-   FIRST WITCH. He will not be commanded. Here's another,     More potent than the first.            Thunder. Second Apparition: a bloody Child.     SECOND APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!   MACBETH. Had I three ears, I'd hear thee.   SECOND APPARITION. Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn     The power of man, for none of woman born     Shall harm Macbeth.                                Descends.   MACBETH. Then live, Macduff. What need I fear of thee?     But yet I'll make assurance double sure,     And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,     That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,     And sleep in spite of thunder.         Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,                with a tree in his hand.      What is this,     That rises like the issue of a king,     And wears upon his baby brow the round     And top of sovereignty?   ALL. Listen, but speak not to't.   THIRD APPARITION. Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care      Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.     Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until     Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill     Shall come against him.                            Descends.   MACBETH. That will never be.     Who can impress the forest, bid the tree     Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good!     Rebellion's head, rise never till the Wood     Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth     Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath     To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart     Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art     Can tell so much, shall Banquo's issue ever     Reign in this kingdom?   ALL. Seek to know no more.   MACBETH. I will be satisfied! Deny me this,     And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.     Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?                                                        Hautboys.   FIRST WITCH. Show!    SECOND WITCH. Show!   THIRD. WITCH. Show!   ALL. Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;     Come like shadows, so depart!      A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;                    Banquo's Ghost following.    MACBETH. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down!     Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,     Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.     A third is like the former. Filthy hags!     Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!     What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?     Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more!     And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass     Which shows me many more; and some I see     That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.     Horrible sight! Now I see 'tis true;     For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,      And points at them for his. What, is this so?   FIRST WITCH. Ay, sir, all this is so. But why     Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?     Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,     And show the best of our delights.     I'll charm the air to give a sound,     While you perform your antic round,     That this great King may kindly say     Our duties did his welcome pay.                                     Music. The Witches dance and                                         then vanish with Hecate.   MACBETH. are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour     Stand ay accursed in the calendar!     Come in, without there!                      Enter Lennox.    LENNOX. What's your Grace's will?   MACBETH. Saw you the weird sisters?   LENNOX. No, my lord.    MACBETH. Came they not by you?   LENNOX. No indeed, my lord.   MACBETH. Infected be the 'air whereon they ride,     And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear     The galloping of horse. Who wast came by?   LENNOX. 'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word     Macduff is fled to England.   MACBETH. Fled to England?   LENNOX. Ay, my good lord.   MACBETH. [Aside.] Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.     The flighty purpose never is o'ertook     Unless the deed go with it. From this moment     The very firstlings of my heart shall be     The firstlings of my hand. And even now,     To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:     The castle of Macduff I will surprise,     Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword     His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls     That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;     This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.      But no more sights! -Where are these gentlemen?     Come, bring me where they are.                       Exeunt.     SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.  Enter Lady Macduff, her Son, and Ross.    LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land?   ROSS. You must have patience, madam.   LADY MACDUFF. He had none;     His flight was madness. When our actions do not,     Our fears do make us traitors.   ROSS. You know not     Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.   LADY MACDUFF. Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,     His mansion, and his titles, in a place     From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;     He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,     The most diminutive of birds, will fight,     Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.     All is the fear and nothing is the love;     As little is the wisdom, where the flight     So runs against all reason.   ROSS. My dearest coz,      I pray you, school yourself. But for your husband,     He is noble, wise, Judicious, and best knows     The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further;     But cruel are the times when we are traitors     And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor     From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,     But float upon a wild and violent sea     Each way and move. I take my leave of you;     Shall not be long but I'll be here again.     Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward     To what they were before. My pretty cousin,     Blessing upon you!   LADY MACDUFF. Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.   ROSS. I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,     It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.     I take my leave at once.                               Exit.   LADY MACDUFF. Sirrah, your father's dead.     And what will you do now? How will you live?   SON. As birds do, Mother.   LADY MACDUFF. What, with worms and flies?    SON. With what I get, I mean; and so do they.   LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,     The pitfall nor the gin.   SON. Why should I, Mother? Poor birds they are not set for.     My father is not dead, for all your saying.   LADY MACDUFF. Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father?   SON. Nay, how will you do for a husband?   LADY MACDUFF. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.   SON. Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.   LADY MACDUFF. Thou speak'st with all thy wit, and yet, i' faith,     With wit enough for thee.   SON. Was my father a traitor, Mother?   LADY MACDUFF. Ay, that he was.   SON. What is a traitor?   LADY MACDUFF. Why one that swears and lies.   SON. And be all traitors that do so?   LADY MACDUFF. Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be      hanged.   SON. And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?   LADY MACDUFF. Everyone.    SON. Who must hang them?   LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men.   SON. Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and     swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.   LADY MACDUFF. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do     for a father?   SON. If he were dead, you'ld weep for him; if you would not, it     were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.   LADY MACDUFF. Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!                      Enter a Messenger.    MESSENGER. Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,     Though in your state of honor I am perfect.     I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.     If you will take a homely man's advice,     Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.     To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;     To do worse to you were fell cruelty,     Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!      I dare abide no longer.                                Exit.   LADY MACDUFF. Whither should I fly?     I have done no harm. But I remember now     I am in this earthly world, where to do harm     Is often laudable, to do good sometime     Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,     Do I put up that womanly defense,     To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?                        Enter Murtherers.    FIRST MURTHERER. Where is your husband?   LADY MACDUFF. I hope, in no place so unsanctified     Where such as thou mayst find him.   FIRST MURTHERER. He's a traitor.   SON. Thou liest, thou shag-ear'd villain!   FIRST MURTHERER. What, you egg!                                                       Stabs him.     Young fry of treachery!   SON. He has kill'd me, Mother.      Run away, I pray you!                                  Dies.                             Exit Lady Macduff, crying "Murther!"                                Exeunt Murtherers, following her.     SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.  Enter Malcolm and Macduff.    MALCOLM. Let us seek out some desolate shade and there     Weep our sad bosoms empty.   MACDUFF. Let us rather     Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men     Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn     New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows     Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds     As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out     Like syllable of dolor.   MALCOLM. What I believe, I'll wall;     What know, believe; and what I can redress,     As I shall find the time to friend, I will.     What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.     This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,     Was once thought honest. You have loved him well;     He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young, but something     You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom      To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb     To appease an angry god.   MACDUFF. I am not treacherous.   MALCOLM. But Macbeth is.     A good and virtuous nature may recoil     In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;     That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.     Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.     Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,     Yet grace must still look so.   MACDUFF. I have lost my hopes.   MALCOLM. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.     Why in that rawness left you wife and child,     Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,     Without leave-taking? I pray you,     Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,     But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,     Whatever I shall think.   MACDUFF. Bleed, bleed, poor country!     Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,      For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy wrongs;     The title is affeer'd. Fare thee well, lord.     I would not be the villain that thou think'st     For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp     And the rich East to boot.   MALCOLM. Be not offended;     I speak not as in absolute fear of you.     I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;     It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash     Is added to her wounds. I think withal     There would be hands uplifted in my right;     And here from gracious England have I offer     Of goodly thousands. But for all this,     When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,     Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country     Shall have more vices than it had before,     More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,     By him that shall succeed.   MACDUFF. What should he be?   MALCOLM. It is myself I mean, in whom I know      All the particulars of vice so grafted     That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth     Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state     Esteem him as a lamb, being compared     With my confineless harms.   MACDUFF. Not in the legions     Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd     In evils to top Macbeth.   MALCOLM. I grant him bloody,     Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,     Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin     That has a name. But there's no bottom, none,     In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,     Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up     The cestern of my lust, and my desire     All continent impediments would o'erbear     That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth     Than such an one to reign.   MACDUFF. Boundless intemperance     In nature is a tyranny; it hath been      The untimely emptying of the happy throne,     And fall of many kings. But fear not yet     To take upon you what is yours. You may     Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty     And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.     We have willing dames enough; there cannot be     That vulture in you to devour so many     As will to greatness dedicate themselves,     Finding it so inclined.   MALCOLM. With this there grows     In my most ill-composed affection such     A stanchless avarice that, were I King,     I should cut off the nobles for their lands,     Desire his jewels and this other's house,     And my more-having would be as a sauce     To make me hunger more, that I should forge     Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,     Destroying them for wealth.   MACDUFF. This avarice     Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root      Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been     The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear;     Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will     Of your mere own. All these are portable,     With other graces weigh'd.   MALCOLM. But I have none. The king-becoming graces,     As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,     Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,     Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,     I have no relish of them, but abound     In the division of each several crime,     Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should     Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,     Uproar the universal peace, confound     All unity on earth.   MACDUFF. O Scotland, Scotland!   MALCOLM. If such a one be fit to govern, speak.     I am as I have spoken.   MACDUFF. Fit to govern?     No, not to live. O nation miserable!      With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,     When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,     Since that the truest issue of thy throne     By his own interdiction stands accursed     And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father     Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,     Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,     Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!     These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself     Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,     Thy hope ends here!   MALCOLM. Macduff, this noble passion,     Child of integrity, hath from my soul     Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts     To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth     By many of these trains hath sought to win me     Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me     From over-credulous haste. But God above     Deal between thee and me! For even now     I put myself to thy direction and      Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure     The taints and blames I laid upon myself,     For strangers to my nature. I am yet     Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,     Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,     At no time broke my faith, would not betray     The devil to his fellow, and delight     No less in truth than life. My first false speaking     Was this upon myself. What I am truly     Is thine and my poor country's to command.     Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,     Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men     Already at a point, was setting forth.     Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness     Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?   MACDUFF. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once     'Tis hard to reconcile.                       Enter a Doctor.     MALCOLM. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you?   DOCTOR. Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls     That stay his cure. Their malady convinces     The great assay of art, but at his touch,     Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,     They presently amend.   MALCOLM. I thank you, Doctor.                     Exit Doctor.   MACDUFF. What's the disease he means?   MALCOLM. 'Tis call'd the evil:     A most miraculous work in this good King,     Which often, since my here-remain in England,     I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,     Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,     All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,     The mere despair of surgery, he cures,     Hanging a golden stamp about their necks     Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken,     To the succeeding royalty he leaves     The healing benediction. With this strange virtue     He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,      And sundry blessings hang about his throne     That speak him full of grace.                      Enter Ross.    MACDUFF. See, who comes here?   MALCOLM. My countryman, but yet I know him not.   MACDUFF. My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.   MALCOLM. I know him now. Good God, betimes remove     The means that makes us strangers!   ROSS. Sir, amen.   MACDUFF. Stands Scotland where it did?   ROSS. Alas, poor country,     Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot     Be call'd our mother, but our grave. Where nothing,     But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;     Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air,     Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems     A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell     Is there scarce ask'd for who, and good men's lives      Expire before the flowers in their caps,     Dying or ere they sicken.   MACDUFF. O, relation     Too nice, and yet too true!   MALCOLM. What's the newest grief?   ROSS. That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker;     Each minute teems a new one.   MACDUFF. How does my wife?   ROSS. Why, well.   MACDUFF. And all my children?   ROSS. Well too.   MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?   ROSS. No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.   MACDUFF. Be not a niggard of your speech. How goest?   ROSS. When I came hither to transport the tidings,     Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor     Of many worthy fellows that were out,     Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,     For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.     Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland      Would create soldiers, make our women fight,     To doff their dire distresses.   MALCOLM. Be't their comfort     We are coming thither. Gracious England hath     Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;     An older and a better soldier none     That Christendom gives out.   ROSS. Would I could answer     This comfort with the like! But I have words     That would be howl'd out in the desert air,     Where hearing should not latch them.   MACDUFF. What concern they?     The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief     Due to some single breast?   ROSS. No mind that's honest     But in it shares some woe, though the main part     Pertains to you alone.   MACDUFF. If it be mine,     Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.   ROSS. Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,      Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound     That ever yet they heard.   MACDUFF. Humh! I guess at it.   ROSS. Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes     Savagely slaughter'd. To relate the manner     Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer,     To add the death of you.   MALCOLM. Merciful heaven!     What, man! Neer pull your hat upon your brows;     Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak     Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.   MACDUFF. My children too?   ROSS. Wife, children, servants, all     That could be found.   MACDUFF. And I must be from thence!     My wife kill'd too?   ROSS. I have said.   MALCOLM. Be comforted.     Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,     To cure this deadly grief.    MACDUFF. He has no children. All my pretty ones?     Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?     What, all my pretty chickens and their dam     At one fell swoop?   MALCOLM. Dispute it like a man.   MACDUFF. I shall do so,     But I must also feel it as a man.     I cannot but remember such things were     That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,     And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,     They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,     Not for their own demerits, but for mine,     Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!   MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief     Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.   MACDUFF. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes     And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,     Cut short all intermission; front to front     Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;     Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,      Heaven forgive him too!   MALCOLM. This tune goes manly.     Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,     Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth     Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above     Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may,     The night is long that never finds the day.          Exeunt.     <<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS PROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY WITH PERMISSION.

Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman.    DOCTOR. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no     truth in your report. When was it she last walked?   GENTLEWOMAN. Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen her     rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her     closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it,     afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while     in a most fast sleep.   DOCTOR. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the     benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery     agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances,     what, at any time, have you heard her say?   GENTLEWOMAN. That, sir, which I will not report after her.   DOCTOR. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should.   GENTLEWOMAN. Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to     confirm my speech.                  Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.       Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise, and, upon my     life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.   DOCTOR. How came she by that light?   GENTLEWOMAN. Why, it stood by her. She has light by her      continually; 'tis her command.   DOCTOR. You see, her eyes are open.   GENTLEWOMAN. Ay, but their sense is shut.   DOCTOR. What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.   GENTLEWOMAN. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus     washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of     an hour.   LADY MACBETH. Yet here's a spot.   DOCTOR. Hark, she speaks! I will set down what comes from her, to     satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.   LADY MACBETH. Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then 'tis     time to do't. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and     afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our     power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have     had so much blood in him?    DOCTOR. Do you mark that?   LADY MACBETH. The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now? What,     will these hands neer be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no more     o' that. You mar all with this starting.   DOCTOR. Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.   GENTLEWOMAN. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that.     Heaven knows what she has known.   LADY MACBETH. Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes     of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!   DOCTOR. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.   GENTLEWOMAN. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the     dignity of the whole body.   DOCTOR. Well, well, well-   GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir.   DOCTOR. This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those     which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their     beds.   LADY MACBETH. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not so     pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come out     on's grave.    DOCTOR. Even so?   LADY MACBETH. To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate. Come,     come, come, come, give me your hand.What's done cannot be undone.     To bed, to bed, to bed. Exit.   DOCTOR. Will she go now to bed?   GENTLEWOMAN. Directly.   DOCTOR. Foul whisperings are abroad. Unnatural deeds     Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds     To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.     More needs she the divine than the physician.     God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;     Remove from her the means of all annoyance,     And still keep eyes upon her. So good night.     My mind she has mated and amazed my sight.     I think, but dare not speak.   GENTLEWOMAN. Good night, good doctor.                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane. Drum and colors.  Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, and Soldiers.    MENTEITH. The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,     His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.     Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes     Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm     Excite the mortified man.   ANGUS. Near Birnam Wood     Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.   CAITHNESS. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?   LENNOX. For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file     Of all the gentry. There is Seward's son     And many unrough youths that even now     Protest their first of manhood.   MENTEITH. What does the tyrant?   CAITHNESS. Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.     Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,     Do call it valiant fury; but, for certain,     He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause      Within the belt of rule.   ANGUS. Now does he feel     His secret murthers sticking on his hands,     Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;     Those he commands move only in command,     Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title     Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe     Upon a dwarfish thief.   MENTEITH. Who then shall blame     His pester'd senses to recoil and start,     When all that is within him does condemn     Itself for being there?   CAITHNESS. Well, march we on     To give obedience where 'tis truly owed.     Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,     And with him pour we, in our country's purge,     Each drop of us.   LENNOX. Or so much as it needs     To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.     Make we our march towards Birnam.           Exeunt marching.     SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.  Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.    MACBETH. Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!     Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane     I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?     Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know     All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:     "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman     Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly, false Thanes,     And mingle with the English epicures!     The mind I sway by and the heart I bear     Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.                         Enter a Servant.      The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!     Where got'st thou that goose look?   SERVANT. There is ten thousand-   MACBETH. Geese, villain?    SERVANT. Soldiers, sir.   MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,     Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?     Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine     Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?   SERVANT. The English force, so please you.   MACBETH. Take thy face hence.                    Exit Servant.     Seyton-I am sick at heart,     When I behold- Seyton, I say!- This push     Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.     I have lived long enough. My way of life     Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,     And that which should accompany old age,     As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,     I must not look to have; but in their stead,     Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,     Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.     Seyton!                         Enter Seyton.     SEYTON. What's your gracious pleasure?   MACBETH. What news more?   SEYTON. All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.   MACBETH. I'll fight, 'til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.     Give me my armor.   SEYTON. 'Tis not needed yet.   MACBETH. I'll put it on.     Send out more horses, skirr the country round,     Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.     How does your patient, doctor?   DOCTOR. Not so sick, my lord,     As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,     That keep her from her rest.   MACBETH. Cure her of that.     Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,     Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,     Raze out the written troubles of the brain,     And with some sweet oblivious antidote     Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff      Which weighs upon the heart?   DOCTOR. Therein the patient     Must minister to himself.   MACBETH. Throw physic to the dogs, I'll none of it.     Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.     Seyton, send out. Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.     Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast     The water of my land, find her disease     And purge it to a sound and pristine health,     I would applaud thee to the very echo,     That should applaud again. Pull't off, I say.     What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug     Would scour these English hence? Hearst thou of them?   DOCTOR. Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation     Makes us hear something.   MACBETH. Bring it after me.     I will not be afraid of death and bane     Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.   DOCTOR. [Aside.] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,     Profit again should hardly draw me here.             Exeunt.     SCENE IV. Country near Birnam Wood. Drum and colors.  Enter Malcolm, old Seward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.    MALCOLM. Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand     That chambers will be safe.   MENTEITH. We doubt it nothing.   SIWARD. What wood is this before us?   MENTEITH. The Wood of Birnam.   MALCOLM. Let every soldier hew him down a bough,     And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow     The numbers of our host, and make discovery     Err in report of us.   SOLDIERS. It shall be done.   SIWARD. We learn no other but the confident tyrant     Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure     Our setting down before't.   MALCOLM. 'Tis his main hope;     For where there is advantage to be given,     Both more and less have given him the revolt,      And none serve with him but constrained things     Whose hearts are absent too.   MACDUFF. Let our just censures     Attend the true event, and put we on     Industrious soldiership.   SIWARD. The time approaches     That will with due decision make us know     What we shall say we have and what we owe.     Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,     But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.     Towards which advance the war.                                                 Exeunt Marching.     SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.  Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with drum and colors.    MACBETH. Hang out our banners on the outward walls;     The cry is still, "They come!" Our castle's strength     Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie     Till famine and the ague eat them up.     Were they not forced with those that should be ours,     We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,     And beat them backward home.                                           A cry of women within.     What is that noise?   SEYTON. It is the cry of women, my good lord.            Exit.   MACBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears:     The time has been, my senses would have cool'd     To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair     Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir     As life were in't. I have supp'd full with horrors;     Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,     Cannot once start me.                     Re-enter Seyton.      Wherefore was that cry?   SEYTON. The Queen, my lord, is dead.   MACBETH. She should have died hereafter;     There would have been a time for such a word.     Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow     Creeps in this petty pace from day to day     To the last syllable of recorded time;     And all our yesterdays have lighted fools     The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!     Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player     That struts and frets his hour upon the stage     And then is heard no more. It is a tale     Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,     Signifying nothing.                   Enter a Messenger.      Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.    MESSENGER. Gracious my lord,     I should report that which I say I saw,     But know not how to do it.   MACBETH. Well, say, sir.   MESSENGER. As I did stand my watch upon the hill,     I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,     The Wood began to move.   MACBETH. Liar and slave!   MESSENGER. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.     Within this three mile may you see it coming;     I say, a moving grove.   MACBETH. If thou speak'st false,     Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,     Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,     I care not if thou dost for me as much.     I pull in resolution and begin     To doubt the equivocation of the fiend     That lies like truth. "Fear not, till Birnam Wood     Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood     Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!      If this which he avouches does appear,     There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.     I 'gin to be aweary of the sun     And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.     Ring the alarum bell! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!     At least we'll die with harness on our back.         Exeunt.     SCENE VI. Dunsinane.  Before the castle.  Enter Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff, and their Army, with boughs. Drum and colors.    MALCOLM. Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,     And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,     Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,     Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we     Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,     According to our order.   SIWARD. Fare you well.     Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight,     Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.   MACDUFF. Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,     Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.                                                          Exeunt.     SCENE VII. Dunsinane.  Before the castle.  Alarums.  Enter Macbeth.    MACBETH. They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,     But bear-like I must fight the course. What's he     That was not born of woman? Such a one     Am I to fear, or none.                       Enter young Siward.    YOUNG SIWARD. What is thy name?   MACBETH. Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.   YOUNG SIWARD. No, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name     Than any is in hell.   MACBETH. My name's Macbeth.   YOUNG SIWARD. The devil himself could not pronounce a title     More hateful to mine ear.   MACBETH. No, nor more fearful.   YOUNG SIWARD O Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword     I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.                            They fight, and young Seward is slain.   MACBETH. Thou wast born of woman.     But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,     Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.              Exit.                  Alarums. Enter Macduff.    MACDUFF. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!     If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine,     My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.     I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms     Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,     Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,     I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;     By this great clatter, one of greatest note     Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!     And more I beg not.                           Exit. Alarums.                  Enter Malcolm and old Siward.     SIWARD. This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd.     The tyrant's people on both sides do fight,     The noble Thanes do bravely in the war,     The day almost itself professes yours,     And little is to do.   MALCOLM. We have met with foes     That strike beside us.   SIWARD. Enter, sir, the castle.                                                  Exeunt. Alarum.     SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.  Enter Macbeth.    MACBETH. Why should I play the Roman fool and die     On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes     Do better upon them.                        Enter Macduff.    MACDUFF. Turn, hell hound, turn!   MACBETH. Of all men else I have avoided thee.     But get thee back, my soul is too much charged     With blood of thine already.   MACDUFF. I have no words.     My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain     Than terms can give thee out!                    They fight.   MACBETH. Thou losest labor.     As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air     With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.     Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;      I bear a charmed life, which must not yield     To one of woman born.   MACDUFF. Despair thy charm,     And let the angel whom thou still hast served     Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb     Untimely ripp'd.   MACBETH. Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,     For it hath cow'd my better part of man!     And be these juggling fiends no more believed     That patter with us in a double sense,     That keep the word of promise to our ear     And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.   MACDUFF. Then yield thee, coward,     And live to be the show and gaze o' the time.     We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,     Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,     "Here may you see the tyrant."   MACBETH. I will not yield,     To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,     And to be baited with the rabble's curse.      Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,     And thou opposed, being of no woman born,     Yet I will try the last. Before my body     I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduff,     And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"                                        Exeunt fighting. Alarums.     SCENE IX.  Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colors, Malcolm, old Siward, Ross, the other Thanes, and Soldiers.    MALCOLM. I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.   SIWARD. Some must go off, and yet, by these I see,     So great a day as this is cheaply bought.   MALCOLM. Macduff is missing, and your noble son.   ROSS. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.     He only lived but till he was a man,     The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd     In the unshrinking station where he fought,     But like a man he died.   SIWARD. Then he is dead?   ROSS. Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow     Must not be measured by his worth, for then     It hath no end.   SIWARD. Had he his hurts before?   ROSS. Ay, on the front.   SIWARD. Why then, God's soldier be he!     Had I as many sons as I have hairs,      I would not wish them to a fairer death.     And so his knell is knoll'd.   MALCOLM. He's worth more sorrow,     And that I'll spend for him.   SIWARD. He's worth no more:     They say he parted well and paid his score,     And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.               Re-enter Macduff, with Macbeth's head.    MACDUFF. Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold where stands     The usurper's cursed head. The time is free.     I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl     That speak my salutation in their minds,     Whose voices I desire aloud with mine-     Hail, King of Scotland!   ALL. Hail, King of Scotland!                         Flourish.   MALCOLM. We shall not spend a large expense of time     Before we reckon with your several loves     And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen,      Henceforth be Earls, the first that ever Scotland     In such an honor named. What's more to do,     Which would be planted newly with the time,     As calling home our exiled friends abroad     That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,     Producing forth the cruel ministers     Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,     Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands     Took off her life; this, and what needful else     That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace     We will perform in measure, time, and place.     So thanks to all at once and to each one,     Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.                                                Flourish. Exeunt. -THE END-
