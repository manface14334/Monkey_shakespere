Two households, both alike in dignity,In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.From forth the fatal loins of these two foesA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrowsDoth with their death bury their parents' strife.The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,And the continuance of their parents' rage,Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;The which if you with patient ears attend,What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.[Exit.]ACT I. Scene I.Verona. A public place.Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the houseof Capulet.Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will takethe wall of any man or maid of Montague's.Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to thewall.Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's menfrom the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I havefought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut offtheir heads.Greg. The heads of the maids?Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.Take it in what sense thou wilt.Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known Iam a pretty piece of flesh.Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadstbeen poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house ofMontagues.Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.Greg. How? turn thy back and run?Samp. Fear me not.Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which isdisgrace to them, if they bear it.Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite mythumb, sir.Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man asyou.Abr. No better.Samp. Well, sir.Enter Benvolio.Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of mymaster's kinsmen.Samp. Yes, better, sir.Abr. You lie.Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.They fight.Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]Put up your swords. You know not what you do.Enter Tybalt.Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,Or manage it to part these men with me.Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the wordAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs orpartisans.Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is comeAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.Enter Old Montague and his Wife.Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,That quench the fire of your pernicious rageWith purple fountains issuing from your veins!On pain of torture, from those bloody handsThrow your mistempered weapons to the groundAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.Three civil brawls, bred of an airy wordBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streetsAnd made Verona's ancient citizensCast by their grave beseeming ornamentsTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.If ever you disturb our streets again,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.For this time all the rest depart away.You, Capulet, shall go along with me;And, Montague, come you this afternoon,To know our farther pleasure in this case,To old Freetown, our common judgment place.Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?Ben. Here were the servants of your adversaryAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.I drew to part them. In the instant cameThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,He swung about his head and cut the winds,Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,Came more and more, and fought on part and part,Till the Prince came, who parted either part.M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?Right glad I am he was not at this fray.Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sunPeer'd forth the golden window of the East,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;Where, underneath the grove of sycamoreThat westward rooteth from the city's side,So early walking did I see your son.Towards him I made; but he was ware of meAnd stole into the covert of the wood.I- measuring his affections by my own,Which then most sought where most might not be found,Being one too many by my weary self-Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;But all so soon as the all-cheering sunShould in the furthest East bean to drawThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,Away from light steals home my heavy sonAnd private in his chamber pens himself,Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylightAnd makes himself an artificial night.Black and portentous must this humour proveUnless good counsel may the cause remove.Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of himBen. Have you importun'd him by any means?Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;But he, his own affections' counsellor,Is to himself- I will not say how true-But to himself so secret and so close,So far from sounding and discovery,As is the bud bit with an envious wormEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the airOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,We would as willingly give cure as know.Enter Romeo.Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stayTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,Exeunt [Montague and Wife].Ben. Good morrow, cousin.Rom. Is the day so young?Ben. But new struck nine.Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.Was that my father that went hence so fast?Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.Ben. In love?Rom. Out-Ben. Of love?Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,Should without eyes see pathways to his will!Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!O anything, of nothing first create!O heavy lightness! serious vanity!Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!Still-waking sleep, that is not what it isThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.Dost thou not laugh?Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.Rom. Good heart, at what?Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prestWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shownDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.What is it else? A madness most discreet,A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.Farewell, my coz.Ben. Soft! I will go along.An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:This is not Romeo, he's some other where.Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?Ben. Groan? Why, no;But sadly tell me who.Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hitWith Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.She will not stay the siege of loving terms,Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.O, she's rich in beauty; only poorThat, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;For beauty, starv'd with her severity,Cuts beauty off from all posterity.She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,To merit bliss by making me despair.She hath forsworn to love, and in that vowDo I live dead that live to tell it now.Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.Examine other beauties.Rom. 'Tis the wayTo call hers (exquisite) in question more.These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.He that is strucken blind cannot forgetThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.Show me a mistress that is passing fair,What doth her beauty serve but as a noteWhere I may read who pass'd that passing fair?Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.Scene II.A Street.Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,For men so old as we to keep the peace.Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:My child is yet a stranger in the world,She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;Let two more summers wither in their prideEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;She is the hopeful lady of my earth.But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;My will to her consent is but a part.An she agree, within her scope of choiceLies my consent and fair according voice.This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,Whereto I have invited many a guest,Such as I love; and you among the store,One more, most welcome, makes my number more.At my poor house look to behold this nightEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.Such comfort as do lusty young men feelWhen well apparell'd April on the heelOf limping Winter treads, even such delightAmong fresh female buds shall you this nightInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,And like her most whose merit most shall be;Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,sirrah, trudge aboutThrough fair Verona; find those persons outWhose names are written there, and to them say,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is writtenthat the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailorwith his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painterwith his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names arehere writ, and can never find what names the writing personhath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!Enter Benvolio and Romeo.Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;One desperate grief cures with another's languish.Take thou some new infection to thy eye,And the rank poison of the old will die.Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.Ben. For what, I pray thee?Rom. For your broken shin.Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, canyou read anything you see?Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;The lady widow of Vitruvio;Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;Mercutio and his brother Valentine;Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;Lucio and the lively Helena.'[Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should theycome?Serv. Up.Rom. Whither?Serv. To supper, to our house.Rom. Whose house?Serv. My master's.Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the greatrich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I praycome and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet'sSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;With all the admired beauties of Verona.Go thither, and with unattainted eyeCompare her face with some that I shall show,And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.Rom. When the devout religion of mine eyeMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sunNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'dYour lady's love against some other maidThat I will show you shining at this feast,And she shall scant show well that now seems best.Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]Scene III.Capulet's house.Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!Enter Juliet.Jul. How now? Who calls?Nurse. Your mother.Jul. Madam, I am here.What is your will?Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.Wife. She's not fourteen.Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-She is not fourteen. How long is it nowTo Lammastide?Wife. A fortnight and odd days.Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;She was too good for me. But, as I said,On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;That shall she, marry; I remember it well.'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),Of all the days of the year, upon that day;For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.My lord and you were then at Mantua.Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,When it did taste the wormwood on the nippleOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,To bid me trudge.And since that time it is eleven years,For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,She could have run and waddled all about;For even the day before, she broke her brow;And then my husband (God be with his soul!'A was a merry man) took up the child.'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'To see now how a jest shall come about!I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laughTo think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it browA bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very themeI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,How stands your disposition to be married?Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,Are made already mothers. By my count,I was your mother much upon these yearsThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a manAs all the world- why he's a man of wax.Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?This night you shall behold him at our feast.Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;Examine every married lineament,And see how one another lends content;And what obscur'd in this fair volume liesFind written in the margent of his eyes,This precious book of love, this unbound lover,To beautify him only lacks a cover.The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much prideFor fair without the fair within to hide.That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;So shall you share all that he doth possess,By having him making yourself no less.Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by menWife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;But no more deep will I endart mine eyeThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.Enter Servingman.Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, andeverything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech youfollow straight.Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].Juliet, the County stays.Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.Exeunt.Scene IV.A street.Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;Torchbearers.Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?Or shall we on without apology?Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spokeAfter the prompter, for our entrance;But, let them measure us by what they will,We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.Being but heavy, I will bear the light.Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoesWith nimble soles; I have a soul of leadSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wingsAnd soar with them above a common bound.Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaftTo soar with his light feathers; and so boundI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-Too great oppression for a tender thing.Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.Give me a case to put my visage in.A visor for a visor! What care IWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner inBut every man betake him to his legs.Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heartTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,I'll be a candle-holder and look on;The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mireOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'stUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!Rom. Nay, that's not so.Mer. I mean, sir, in delayWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.Take our good meaning, for our judgment sitsFive times in that ere once in our five wits.Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;But 'tis no wit to go.Mer. Why, may one ask?Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.Mer. And so did I.Rom. Well, what was yours?Mer. That dreamers often lie.Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.She is the fairies' midwife, and she comesIn shape no bigger than an agate stoneOn the forefinger of an alderman,Drawn with a team of little atomiesAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,Not half so big as a round little wormPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.And in this state she 'gallops night by nightThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tailTickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,Then dreams he of another benefice.Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,Of healths five fadom deep; and then anonDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or twoAnd sleeps again. This is that very MabThat plats the manes of horses in the nightAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,Which once untangled much misfortune bodesThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,That presses them and learns them first to bear,Making them women of good carriage.This is she-Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!Thou talk'st of nothing.Mer. True, I talk of dreams;Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;Which is as thin of substance as the air,And more inconstant than the wind, who wooesEven now the frozen bosom of the NorthAnd, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.Supper is done, and we shall come too late.Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgivesSome consequence, yet hanging in the stars,Shall bitterly begin his fearful dateWith this night's revels and expire the termOf a despised life, clos'd in my breast,By some vile forfeit of untimely death.But he that hath the steerage of my courseDirect my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!Ben. Strike, drum.They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]Scene V.Capulet's house.Servingmen come forth with napkins.1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men'shands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, asthou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone andNell.Anthony, and Potpan!2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for andsought for, in the great chamber.3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guestsand Gentlewomen to the Maskers.Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toesUnplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you allWill now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the dayThat I have worn a visor and could tellA whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.Music plays, and they dance.More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,For you and I are past our dancing days.How long is't now since last yourself and IWere in a mask?2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;His son is thirty.Cap. Will you tell me that?His son was but a ward two years ago.Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich thehand Of yonder knight?Serv. I know not, sir.Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!It seems she hangs upon the cheek of nightLike a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!So shows a snowy dove trooping with crowsAs yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.The measure done, I'll watch her place of standAnd, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slaveCome hither, cover'd with an antic face,To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;A villain, that is hither come in spiteTo scorn at our solemnity this night.Cap. Young Romeo is it?Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.'A bears him like a portly gentleman,And, to say truth, Verona brags of himTo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.I would not for the wealth of all this townHere in my house do him disparagement.Therefore be patient, take no note of him.It is my will; the which if thou respect,Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.I'll not endure him.Cap. He shall be endur'd.What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!Am I the master here, or you? Go to!You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!You'll make a mutiny among my guests!You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.Cap. Go to, go to!You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meetingMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest handThis holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready standTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,Which mannerly devotion shows in this;For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]Jul. You kiss by th' book.Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.Rom. What is her mother?Nurse. Marry, bachelor,Her mother is the lady of the house.And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.I tell you, he that can lay hold of herShall have the chinks.Rom. Is she a Capulet?O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;I'll to my rest.Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?Nurse. I know not.Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,My grave is like to be my wedding bed.Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,The only son of your great enemy.Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!Too early seen unknown, and known too late!Prodigious birth of love it is to meThat I must love a loathed enemy.Nurse. What's this? what's this?Jul. A rhyme I learnt even nowOf one I danc'd withal.One calls within, 'Juliet.'Nurse. Anon, anon!Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.PROLOGUEEnter Chorus.Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,And young affection gapes to be his heir;That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.Being held a foe, he may not have accessTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,And she as much in love, her means much lessTo meet her new beloved anywhere;But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.Exit.ACT II. Scene I.A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo alone.Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.[Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!Mer. He is wise,And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.Call, good Mercutio.Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,One nickname for her purblind son and heir,Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trimWhen King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,That in thy likeness thou appear to us!Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger himTo raise a spirit in his mistress' circleOf some strange nature, letting it there standTill she had laid it and conjur'd it down.That were some spite; my invocationIs fair and honest: in his mistress' name,I conjure only but to raise up him.Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these treesTo be consorted with the humorous night.Blind is his love and best befits the dark.Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.Now will he sit under a medlar treeAnd wish his mistress were that kind of fruitAs maids call medlars when they laugh alone.O, Romeo, that she were, O that she wereAn open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.Come, shall we go?Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain'To seek him here that means not to be found.Exeunt.Scene II.Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo.Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.Enter Juliet above at a window.But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,Who is already sick and pale with griefThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.Be not her maid, since she is envious.Her vestal livery is but sick and green,And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.It is my lady; O, it is my love!O that she knew she were!She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?Her eye discourses; I will answer it.I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,Having some business, do entreat her eyesTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.What if her eyes were there, they in her head?The brightness of her cheek would shame those starsAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heavenWould through the airy region stream so brightThat birds would sing and think it were not night.See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!O that I were a glove upon that hand,That I might touch that cheek!Jul. Ay me!Rom. She speaks.O, speak again, bright angel! for thou artAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,As is a winged messenger of heavenUnto the white-upturned wond'ring eyesOf mortals that fall back to gaze on himWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing cloudsAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?Deny thy father and refuse thy name!Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,And I'll no longer be a Capulet.Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,Nor arm, nor face, nor any other partBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!What's in a name? That which we call a roseBy any other name would smell as sweet.So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,Retain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name;And for that name, which is no part of thee,Take all myself.Rom. I take thee at thy word.Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;Henceforth I never will be Romeo.Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,So stumblest on my counsel?Rom. By a nameI know not how to tell thee who I am.My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,Because it is an enemy to thee.Had I it written, I would tear the word.Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred wordsOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,And the place death, considering who thou art,If any of my kinsmen find thee here.Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;For stony limits cannot hold love out,And what love can do, that dares love attempt.Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eyeThan twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,And I am proof against their enmity.Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;And but thou love me, let them find me here.My life were better ended by their hateThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as farAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,I would adventure for such merchandise.Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheekFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain denyWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment!Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more trueThan those that have more cunning to be strange.I should have been more strange, I must confess,But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,And not impute this yielding to light love,Which the dark night hath so discovered.Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,That monthly changes in her circled orb,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.Rom. What shall I swear by?Jul. Do not swear at all;Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,Which is the god of my idolatry,And I'll believe thee.Rom. If my heart's dear love-Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,I have no joy of this contract to-night.It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;Too like the lightning, which doth cease to beEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.Good night, good night! As sweet repose and restCome to thy heart as that within my breast!Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;And yet I would it were to give again.Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.And yet I wish but for the thing I have.My bounty is as boundless as the sea,My love as deep; the more I give to thee,The more I have, for both are infinite.I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu![Nurse] calls within.Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,Being in night, all this is but a dream,Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.Enter Juliet above.Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.If that thy bent of love be honourable,Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,By one that I'll procure to come to thee,Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll layAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.Nurse. (within) Madam!Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,I do beseech thee-Nurse. (within) Madam!Jul. By-and-by I come.-To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.To-morrow will I send.Rom. So thrive my soul-Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.Enter Juliet again, [above].Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voiceTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mineWith repetition of my Romeo's name.Romeo!Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,Like softest music to attending ears!Jul. Romeo!Rom. My dear?Jul. At what o'clock to-morrowShall I send to thee?Rom. By the hour of nine.Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.I have forgot why I did call thee back.Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,Rememb'ring how I love thy company.Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,Forgetting any other home but this.Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,That lets it hop a little from her hand,Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,And with a silk thread plucks it back again,So loving-jealous of his liberty.Rom. I would I were thy bird.Jul. Sweet, so would I.Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,That I shall say good night till it be morrow.[Exit.]Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.ExitScene III.Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;And flecked darkness like a drunkard reelsFrom forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.Non, ere the sun advance his burning eyeThe day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,I must up-fill this osier cage of oursWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.What is her burying gave, that is her womb;And from her womb children of divers kindWe sucking on her natural bosom find;Many for many virtues excellent,None but for some, and yet all different.O, mickle is the powerful grace that liesIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;For naught so vile that on the earth doth liveBut to the earth some special good doth give;Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,And vice sometime's by action dignified.Within the infant rind of this small flowerPoison hath residence, and medicine power;For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.Two such opposed kings encamp them stillIn man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;And where the worser is predominant,Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.Enter Romeo.Rom. Good morrow, father.Friar. Benedicite!What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?Young son, it argues a distempered headSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,And where care lodges sleep will never lie;But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brainDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.Therefore thy earliness doth me assureThou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;Or if not so, then here I hit it right-Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.I have been feasting with mine enemy,Where on a sudden one hath wounded meThat's by me wounded. Both our remediesWithin thy help and holy physic lies.I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,My intercession likewise steads my foe.Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy driftRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is setOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet;As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,And all combin'd, save what thou must combineBy holy marriage. When, and where, and howWe met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,That thou consent to marry us to-day.Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,So soon forsaken? Young men's love then liesNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.Jesu Maria! What a deal of brineHath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!How much salt water thrown away in waste,To season love, that of it doth not taste!The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sitOf an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:Women may fall when there's no strength in men.Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.Rom. And bad'st me bury love.Friar. Not in a graveTo lay one in, another out to have.Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love nowDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.The other did not so.Friar. O, she knew wellThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.But come, young waverer, come go with me.In one respect I'll thy assistant be;For this alliance may so happy proveTo turn your households' rancour to pure love.Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.Exeunt.Scene IV.A street.Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?Came he not home to-night?Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,Torments him so that he will sure run mad.Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,Hath sent a letter to his father's house.Mer. A challenge, on my life.Ben. Romeo will answer it.Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,being dared.Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a whitewench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; thevery pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy'sbutt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's thecourageous captain of compliments. He fights as you singpricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me hisminim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the verybutcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentlemanof the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, theimmortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.Ben. The what?Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a verytall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strangeflies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who standso much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the oldbench? O, their bones, their bones!Enter Romeo.Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, howart thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarchflowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, shehad a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a Frenchsalutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeitfairly last night.Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such acase as mine a man may strain courtesy.Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains aman to bow in the hams.Rom. Meaning, to cursy.Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.Rom. A most courteous exposition.Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.Rom. Pink for flower.Mer. Right.Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn outthy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest mayremain, after the wearing, solely singular.Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; forthou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I amsure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast notthere for the goose.Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inchnarrow to an ell broad!Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added tothe goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Nowart thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, byart as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like agreat natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble ina hole.Ben. Stop there, stop there!Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for Iwas come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed tooccupy the argument no longer.Rom. Here's goodly gear!Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].Mer. A sail, a sail!Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.Nurse. Peter!Peter. Anon.Nurse. My fan, Peter.Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face ofthe two.Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.Nurse. Is it good-den?Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial isnow upon the prick of noon.Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find theyoung Romeo?Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when youhave found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngestof that name, for fault of a worse.Nurse. You say well.Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,wisely.Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.Ben. She will endite him to some supper.Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!Rom. What hast thou found?Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that issomething stale and hoar ere it be spentHe walks by them and sings.An old hare hoar,And an old hare hoar,Is very good meat in Lent;But a hare that is hoarIs too much for a scoreWhen it hoars ere it be spent.Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.Rom. I will follow you.Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,[sings] lady, lady, lady.Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchantwas this that was so full of his ropery?Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk andwill speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an'awere lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of hisflirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou muststand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, myweapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw assoon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and thelaw on my side.Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about mequivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, Iwill keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should leadher into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind ofbehaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; andtherefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it werean ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest untothee-Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,Lord! she will be a joyful woman.Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as Itake it, is a gentlemanlike offer.Rom. Bid her deviseSome means to come to shrift this afternoon;And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cellBe shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.Rom. Go to! I say you shall.Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.Within this hour my man shall be with theeAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,Which to the high topgallant of my joyMust be my convoy in the secret night.Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,Two may keep counsel, putting one away?Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman intown, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. Ianger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as anyclout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin bothwith a letter?Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; Iknow it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiestsententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do yougood to hear it.Rom. Commend me to thy lady.Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!Peter. Anon.Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.Exeunt.Scene V.Capulet's orchard.Enter Juliet.Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beamsDriving back shadows over low'ring hills.Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.Now is the sun upon the highmost hillOf this day's journey, and from nine till twelveIs three long hours; yet she is not come.Had she affections and warm youthful blood,She would be as swift in motion as a ball;My words would bandy her to my sweet love,And his to me,But old folks, many feign as they were dead-Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.Enter Nurse [and Peter].O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.[Exit Peter.]Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;If good, thou shamest the music of sweet newsBy playing it to me with so sour a face.Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?Do you not see that I am out of breath?Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breathTo say to me that thou art out of breath?The excuse that thou dost make in this delayIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how tochoose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be betterthan any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and afoot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yetthey are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'llwarrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serveGod.What, have you din'd at home?Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.What says he of our marriage? What of that?Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!Beshrew your heart for sending me aboutTo catch my death with jauncing up and down!Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Whereis your mother?Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"Where is your mother?"'Nurse. O God's Lady dear!Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.Is this the poultice for my aching bones?Henceforward do your messages yourself.Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?Jul. I have.Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;There stays a husband to make you a wife.Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.Hie you to church; I must another way,To fetch a ladder, by the which your loveMust climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.Exeunt.Scene VI.Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy actThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not!Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,It cannot countervail the exchange of joyThat one short minute gives me in her sight.Do thou but close our hands with holy words,Then love-devouring death do what he dare-It is enough I may but call her mine.Friar. These violent delights have violent endsAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honeyIs loathsome in his own deliciousnessAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.Enter Juliet.Here comes the lady. O, so light a footWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.A lover may bestride the gossamerThat idles in the wanton summer air,And yet not fall; so light is vanity.Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joyBe heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be moreTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breathThis neighbour air, and let rich music's tongueUnfold the imagin'd happiness that bothReceive in either by this dear encounter.Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,Brags of his substance, not of ornament.They are but beggars that can count their worth;But my true love is grown to such excesscannot sum up sum of half my wealth.Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;For, by your leaves, you shall not stay aloneTill Holy Church incorporate two in one.[Exeunt.]ACT III. Scene I.A public place.Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he entersthe confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table andsays 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of thesecond cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.Ben. Am I like such a fellow?Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any inItaly; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to bemoved.Ben. And what to?Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with aman that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having noother reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such aneye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrelsas an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten asaddle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with aman for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dogthat hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with atailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, withanother for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilttutor me from quarrelling!Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man shouldbuy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.Mer. The fee simple? O simple!Enter Tybalt and others.Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.Mer. By my heel, I care not.Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.Mer. And but one word with one of us?Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give meoccasion.Mer. Could you not take some occasion without givingTyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou makeminstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's myfiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.Either withdraw unto some private placeAnd reason coldly of your grievances,Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.I will not budge for no man's pleasure,Enter Romeo.Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!Your worship in that sense may call him man.Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can affordNo better term than this: thou art a villain.Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love theeDoth much excuse the appertaining rageTo such a greeting. Villain am I none.Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuriesThat thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,But love thee better than thou canst deviseTill thou shalt know the reason of my love;And so good Capulet, which name I tenderAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.That Imean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword outof his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about yourears ere it be out.Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.Mer. Come, sir, your passado![They fight.]Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hathForbid this bandying in Verona streets.Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies[with his Followers].Mer. I am hurt.A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.Is he gone and hath nothing?Ben. What, art thou hurt?Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.[Exit Page.]Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and youshall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for thisworld. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, amouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,avillain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devilcame you between us? I was hurt under your arm.Rom. I thought all for the best.Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,And soundly too. Your houses![Exit. [supported by Benvolio].Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,My very friend, hath got this mortal hurtIn my behalf- my reputation stain'dWith Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hourHath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,Thy beauty hath made me effeminateAnd in my temper soft'ned valour's steelEnter Benvolio.Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;This but begins the woe others must end.Enter Tybalt.Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?Away to heaven respective lenity,And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back againThat late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soulIs but a little way above our heads,Staying for thine to keep him company.Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,Shalt with him hence.Rom. This shall determine that.They fight. Tybalt falls.Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee deathIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!Ben. Why dost thou stay?Exit Romeo.Enter Citizens.Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?Ben. There lies that Tybalt.Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,and [others].Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover allThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'dOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.O cousin, cousin!Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethinkHow nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withalYour high displeasure. All this- utteredWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-Could not take truce with the unruly spleenOf Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tiltsWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beatsCold death aside and with the other sendsIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterityRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,His agile arm beats down their fatal points,And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose armAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the lifeOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,And to't they go like lightning; for, ere ICould draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,And all those twenty could but kill one life.I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;His fault concludes but what the law should end,The life of Tybalt.Prince. And for that offenceImmediately we do exile him hence.I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;But I'll amerce you with so strong a fineThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.Bear hence this body, and attend our will.Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.Exeunt.Scene II.Capulet's orchard.Enter Juliet alone.Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagonerAs Phaeton would whip you to the WestAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,That runaway eyes may wink, and RomeoLeap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.Lovers can see to do their amorous ritesBy their own beauties; or, if love be blind,It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,And learn me how to lose a winning match,Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,Think true love acted simple modesty.Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;For thou wilt lie upon the wings of nightWhiter than new snow upon a raven's back.Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,Take him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.O, I have bought the mansion of a love,But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this dayAs is the night before some festivalTo an impatient child that hath new robesAnd may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,Enter Nurse, with cords.And she brings news; and every tongue that speaksBut Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cordsThat Romeo bid thee fetch?Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.[Throws them down.]Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy handsNurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!We are undone, lady, we are undone!Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!Jul. Can heaven be so envious?Nurse. Romeo can,Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison moreThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.I am not I, if there be such an 'I';Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!O courteous Tybalt! honest gentlemanThat ever I should live to see thee dead!Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!For who is living, if those two are gone?Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!Despised substance of divinest show!Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-A damned saint, an honourable villain!O nature, what hadst thou to do in hellWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiendIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?Was ever book containing such vile matterSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwellIn such a gorgeous palace!Nurse. There's no trust,No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.Shame come to Romeo!Jul. Blister'd be thy tongueFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'dSole monarch of the universal earth.O, what a beast was I to chide at him!Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy nameWhen I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!Your tributary drops belong to woe,Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;But O, it presses to my memoryLike damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's deathWas woe enough, if it had ended there;Or, if sour woe delights in fellowshipAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,'Romeo is banished'- to speak that wordIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.Where is my father and my mother, nurse?Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.He made you for a highway to my bed;But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find RomeoTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knightAnd bid him come to take his last farewell.Exeunt.Scene III.Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar [Laurence].Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,And thou art wedded to calamity.Enter Romeo.Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doomWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my handThat I yet know not?Friar. Too familiarIs my dear son with such sour company.I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-Not body's death, but body's banishment.Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';For exile hath more terror in his look,Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,But purgatory, torture, hell itself.Hence banished is banish'd from the world,And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axeAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,And turn'd that black word death to banishment.This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dogAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,Live here in heaven and may look on her;But Romeo may not. More validity,More honourable state, more courtship livesIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seizeOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's handAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;But Romeo may not- he is banished.This may flies do, when I from this must fly;They are free men, but I am banished.And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?O friar, the damned use that word in hell;Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,To mangle me with that word 'banished'?Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,To comfort thee, though thou art banished.Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,Doting like me, and like me banished,Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,And fall upon the ground, as I do now,Taking the measure of an unmade grave.Knock [within].Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your willNurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.I come from Lady Juliet.Friar. Welcome then.Enter Nurse.Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friarWhere is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,Just in her case!Friar. O woeful sympathy!Piteous predicament!Nurse. Even so lies she,Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!Why should you fall into so deep an O?Rom. (rises) Nurse-Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?Doth not she think me an old murtherer,Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joyWith blood remov'd but little from her own?Where is she? and how doth she! and what saysMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,And then down falls again.Rom. As if that name,Shot from the deadly level of a gun,Did murther her; as that name's cursed handMurder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,In what vile part of this anatomyDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sackThe hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denoteThe unreasonable fury of a beast.Unseemly woman in a seeming man!Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,I thought thy disposition better temper'd.Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,By doing damned hate upon thyself?Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meetIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,And usest none in that true use indeedWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.Thy noble shape is but a form of waxDigressing from the valour of a man;Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,Misshapen in the conduct of them both,Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,is get afire by thine own ignorance,And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friendAnd turns it to exile. There art thou happy.A pack of blessings light upon thy back;Happiness courts thee in her best array;But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.But look thou stay not till the watch be set,For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,Where thou shalt live till we can find a timeTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee backWith twenty hundred thousand times more joyThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,And bid her hasten all the house to bed,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.Romeo is coming.Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the nightTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:Either be gone before the watch be set,Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,And he shall signify from time to timeEvery good hap to you that chances here.Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,It were a grief so brief to part with thee.Farewell.Exeunt.Scene IV.Capulet's houseEnter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckilyThat we have had no time to move our daughter.Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,And so did I. Well, we were born to die.'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.I promise you, but for your company,I would have been abed an hour ago.Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tenderOf my child's love. I think she will be rul'dIn all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;Acquaint her here of my son Paris' loveAnd bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-But, soft! what day is this?Par. Monday, my lord.Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell herShe shall be married to this noble earl.Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,It may be thought we held him carelessly,Being our kinsman, if we revel much.Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!Afore me, It is so very very lateThat we may call it early by-and-by.Good night.ExeuntScene V.Capulet's orchard.Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.It was the nightingale, and not the lark,That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaksDo lace the severing clouds in yonder East.Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund dayStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.I must be gone and live, or stay and die.Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.It is some meteor that the sun exhalesTo be to thee this night a torchbearerAnd light thee on the way to Mantua.Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.I am content, so thou wilt have it so.I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beatThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.I have more care to stay than will to go.Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!It is the lark that sings so out of tune,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.Some say the lark makes sweet division;This doth not so, for she divideth us.Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!Enter Nurse.Nurse. Madam!Jul. Nurse?Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.The day is broke; be wary, look about.Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.[Exit.]Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.He goeth down.Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?I must hear from thee every day in the hour,For in a minute there are many days.O, by this count I shall be much in yearsEre I again behold my Romeo!Rom. Farewell!I will omit no opportunityThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee.Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serveFor sweet discourses in our time to come.Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!Exit.Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.If thou art fickle, what dost thou with himThat is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,For then I hope thou wilt not keep him longBut send him back.Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.Is she not down so late, or up so early?What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?Enter Mother.Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?Jul. Madam, I am not well.Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;But much of grief shows still some want of wit.Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friendWhich you weep for.Jul. Feeling so the loss,I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his deathAs that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.Jul. What villain, madam?Lady. That same villain Romeo.Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dramThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company;And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfiedWith Romeo till I behold him- dead-Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.Madam, if you could find out but a manTo bear a poison, I would temper it;That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhorsTo hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,To wreak the love I bore my cousin TybaltUpon his body that hath slaughter'd him!Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.What are they, I beseech your ladyship?Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,Hath sorted out a sudden day of joyThat thou expects not nor I look'd not for.Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday mornThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,He shall not make me there a joyful bride!I wonder at this haste, that I must wedEre he that should be husband comes to woo.I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swearIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,And see how he will take it at your hands.Enter Capulet and Nurse.Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,But for the sunset of my brother's sonIt rains downright.How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?Evermore show'ring? In one little bodyThou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body isSailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,Without a sudden calm will oversetThy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?Have you delivered to her our decree?Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.I would the fool were married to her grave!Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,Unworthy as she is, that we have wroughtSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.Proud can I never be of what I hate,But thankful even for hate that is meant love.Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday nextTo go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!You tallow-face!Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,Hear me with patience but to speak a word.Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!I tell thee what- get thee to church a ThursdayOr never after look me in the face.Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blestThat God had lent us but this only child;But now I see this one is one too much,And that we have a curse in having her.Out on her, hilding!Nurse. God in heaven bless her!You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!Nurse. I speak no treason.Cap. O, God-i-god-en!Nurse. May not one speak?Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,For here we need it not.Lady. You are too hot.Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,At home, abroad, alone, in company,Waking or sleeping, still my care hath beenTo have her match'd; and having now providedA gentleman of princely parentage,Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-And then to have a wretched puling fool,A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the cloudsThat sees into the bottom of my grief?O sweet my mother, cast me not away!Delay this marriage for a month, a week;Or if you do not, make the bridal bedIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.How shall that faith return again to earthUnless that husband send it me from heavenBy leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagemsUpon so soft a subject as myself!What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?Some comfort, nurse.Nurse. Faith, here it is.Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothingThat he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,I think it best you married with the County.O, he's a lovely gentleman!Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eyeAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,I think you are happy in this second match,For it excels your first; or if it did not,Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he wereAs living here and you no use of him.Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.Jul. Amen!Nurse. What?Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,To make confession and to be absolv'd.Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongueWhich she hath prais'd him with above compareSo many thousand times? Go, counsellor!Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.I'll to the friar to know his remedy.If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.ACT IV. Scene I.Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.Par. My father Capulet will have it so,And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.Uneven is the course; I like it not.Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,And therefore have I little talk'd of love;For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.Now, sir, her father counts it dangerousThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,And in his wisdom hastes our marriageTo stop the inundation of her tears,Which, too much minded by herself alone,May be put from her by society.Now do you know the reason of this haste.Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.Enter Juliet.Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.Jul. What must be shall be.Friar. That's a certain text.Par. Come you to make confession to this father?Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,For it was bad enough before their spite.Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;And what I spake, I spake it to my face.Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.Are you at leisure, holy father, now,Or shall I come to you at evening massFriar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.My lord, we must entreat the time alone.Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;It strains me past the compass of my wits.I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,On Thursday next be married to this County.Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,Do thou but call my resolution wiseAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,Shall be the label to another deed,Or my true heart with treacherous revoltTurn to another, this shall slay them both.Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,Give me some present counsel; or, behold,'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knifeShall play the empire, arbitrating thatWhich the commission of thy years and artCould to no issue of true honour bring.Be not so long to speak. I long to dieIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,Which craves as desperate an executionAs that is desperate which we would prevent.If, rather than to marry County ParisThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,Then is it likely thou wilt undertakeA thing like death to chide away this shame,That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,From off the battlements of yonder tower,Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurkWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;Or bid me go into a new-made graveAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud-Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-And I will do it without fear or doubt,To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consentTo marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.Take thou this vial, being then in bed,And this distilled liquor drink thou off;When presently through all thy veins shall runA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulseShall keep his native progress, but surcease;No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fadeTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fallLike death when he shuts up the day of life;Each part, depriv'd of supple government,Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk deathThou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comesTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.Then, as the manner of our country is,In thy best robes uncovered on the bierThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vaultWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;And hither shall he come; and he and IWill watch thy waking, and that very nightShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.And this shall free thee from this present shame,If no inconstant toy nor womanish fearAbate thy valour in the acting it.Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperousIn this resolve. I'll send a friar with speedTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.Farewell, dear father.Exeunt.Scene II.Capulet's house.Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,two or three.Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.[Exit a Servingman.]Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they canlick their fingers.Cap. How canst thou try them so?Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his ownfingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes notwith me.Cap. Go, begone.Exit Servingman.We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?Nurse. Ay, forsooth.Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.Enter Juliet.Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sinOf disobedient oppositionTo you and your behests, and am enjoin'dBy holy Laurence to fall prostrate hereTo beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cellAnd gave him what becomed love I might,Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.This is as't should be. Let me see the County.Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,All our whole city is much bound to him.Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closetTo help me sort such needful ornamentsAs you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.Mother. We shall be short in our provision.'Tis now near night.Cap. Tush, I will stir about,And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!They are all forth; well, I will walk myselfTo County Paris, to prepare him upAgainst to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.Exeunt.Scene III.Juliet's chamber.Enter Juliet and Nurse.Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;For I have need of many orisonsTo move the heavens to smile upon my state,Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.Enter Mother.Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessariesAs are behooffull for our state to-morrow.So please you, let me now be left alone,And let the nurse this night sit up with you;For I am sure you have your hands full allIn this so sudden business.Mother. Good night.Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veinsThat almost freezes up the heat of life.I'll call them back again to comfort me.Nurse!- What should she do here?My dismal scene I needs must act alone.Come, vial.What if this mixture do not work at all?Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.Lays down a dagger.What if it be a poison which the friarSubtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'dBecause he married me before to Romeo?I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,For he hath still been tried a holy man.I will not entertain so bad a thought.How if, when I am laid into the tomb,I wake before the time that RomeoCome to redeem me? There's a fearful point!Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?Or, if I live, is it not very likeThe horrible conceit of death and night,Together with the terror of the place-As in a vault, an ancient receptacleWhere for this many hundred years the bonesOf all my buried ancestors are pack'd;Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,At some hours in the night spirits resort-Alack, alack, is it not like that I,So early waking- what with loathsome smells,And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,Environed with all these hideous fears,And madly play with my forefathers' joints,And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's boneAs with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghostSeeking out Romeo, that did spit his bodyUpon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.Scene IV.Capulet's house.Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.Enter Old Capulet.Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;Spare not for cost.Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrowFor this night's watching.Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere nowAll night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;But I will watch you from such watching now.Exeunt Lady and Nurse.Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.What is there? Now, fellow,Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drierlogs.Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logsAnd never trouble Peter for the matter.Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.The County will be here with music straight,For so he said he would.                         Play music.I hear him near.Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!Enter Nurse.Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:Make haste, I say.[Exeunt.]Scene V.Juliet's chamber.[Enter Nurse.]Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,The County Paris hath set up his restThat you shall rest but little. God forgive me!Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!Ay, let the County take you in your bed!He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?[Draws aside the curtains.]What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!O weraday that ever I was born!Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!Enter Mother.Mother. What noise is here?Nurse. O lamentable day!Mother. What is the matter?Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!Help, help! Call help.Enter Father.Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;Life and these lips have long been separated.Death lies on her like an untimely frostUpon the sweetest flower of all the field.Nurse. O lamentable day!Mother. O woful time!Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.O son, the night before thy wedding dayHath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,Flower as she was, deflowered by him.Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;My daughter he hath wedded. I will dieAnd leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,And doth it give me such a sight as this?Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!Most miserable hour that e'er time sawIn lasting labour of his pilgrimage!But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,But one thing to rejoice and solace in,And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!Most lamentable day, most woful dayThat ever ever I did yet behold!O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!Never was seen so black a day as this.O woful day! O woful day!Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!O love! O life! not life, but love in deathCap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou nowTo murther, murther our solemnity?O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,And with my child my joys are buried!Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives notIn these confusions. Heaven and yourselfHad part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,And all the better is it for the maid.Your part in her you could not keep from death,But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.The most you sought was her promotion,For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'dAbove the clouds, as high as heaven itself?O, in this love, you love your child so illThat you run mad, seeing that she is well.She's not well married that lives married long,But she's best married that dies married young.Dry up your tears and stick your rosemaryOn this fair corse, and, as the custom is,In all her best array bear her to church;For though fond nature bids us all lament,Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.Cap. All things that we ordained festivalTurn from their office to black funeral-Our instruments to melancholy bells,Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;And all things change them to the contrary.Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepareTo follow this fair corse unto her grave.The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;Move them no more by crossing their high will.Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.Enter Peter.Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart isfull of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.Pet. You will not then?1. Mus. No.Pet. I will then give it you soundly.1. Mus. What will you give us?Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you theminstrel.1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do younote me?1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with aniron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.'When griping grief the heart doth wound,And doleful dumps the mind oppress,Then music with her silver sound'-Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?What say you, Simon Catling?1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. Itis 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have nogold for sounding.'Then music with her silver soundWith speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.1. Mus.

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleepMy dreams presage some joyful news at hand.My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,And all this day an unaccustom'd spiritLifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.I dreamt my lady came and found me dead(Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)And breath'd such life with kisses in my lipsThat I reviv'd and was an emperor.Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?How doth my lady? Is my father well?How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,For nothing can be ill if she be well.Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,And her immortal part with angels lives.I saw her laid low in her kindred's vaultAnd presently took post to tell it you.O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,Since you did leave it for my office, sir.Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paperAnd hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.Your looks are pale and wild and do importSome misadventure.Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?Man. No, my good lord.Rom. No matter. Get thee goneAnd hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.Exit [Balthasar].Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swiftTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men!I do remember an apothecary,And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I notedIn tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,An alligator stuff'd, and other skinsOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelvesA beggarly account of empty boxes,Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of rosesWere thinly scattered, to make up a show.Noting this penury, to myself I said,'An if a man did need a poison nowWhose sale is present death in Mantua,Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'O, this same thought did but forerun my need,And this same needy man must sell it me.As I remember, this should be the house.Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!Enter Apothecary.Apoth. Who calls so loud?Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me haveA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gearAs will disperse itself through all the veinsThat the life-weary taker mall fall dead,And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breathAs violently as hasty powder fir'dDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's lawIs death to any he that utters them.Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchednessAnd fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;The world affords no law to make thee rich;Then be not poor, but break it and take this.Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you willAnd drink it off, and if you had the strengthOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,Doing more murther in this loathsome world,Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.Come, cordial and not poison, go with meTo Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.Exeunt.Scene II.Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!Enter Friar Laurence.Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,One of our order, to associate meHere in this city visiting the sick,And finding him, the searchers of the town,Suspecting that we both were in a houseWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?John. I could not send it- here it is again-Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,So fearful were they of infection.Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,The letter was not nice, but full of charge,Of dear import; and the neglecting itMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence,Get me an iron crow and bring it straightUnto my cell.John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.She will beshrew me much that RomeoHath had no notice of these accidents;But I will write again to Mantua,And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.Scene III.Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,As signal that thou hear'st something approach.Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand aloneHere in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew(O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.The obsequies that I for thee will keepNightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.Whistle Boy.The boy gives warning something doth approach.What cursed foot wanders this way to-nightTo cross my obsequies and true love's rite?What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,and a crow of iron.Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.Hold, take this letter. Early in the morningSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloofAnd do not interrupt me in my course.Why I descend into this bed of deathIs partly to behold my lady's face,But chiefly to take thence from her dead fingerA precious ring- a ring that I must useIn dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.But if thou, jealous, dost return to pryIn what I farther shall intend to do,By heaven, I will tear thee joint by jointAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.The time and my intents are savage-wild,More fierce and more inexorable farThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.Romeo opens the tomb.Par. This is that banish'd haughty MontagueThat murd'red my love's cousin- with which griefIt is supposed the fair creature died-And here is come to do some villanous shameTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,But not another sin upon my headBy urging me to fury. O, be gone!By heaven, I love thee better than myself,For I come hither arm'd against myself.Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter sayA madman's mercy bid thee run away.Par. I do defy thy, conjurationAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!They fight.Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.[Exit. Paris falls.]Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!What said my man when my betossed soulDid not attend him as we rode? I thinkHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.Said he not so? or did I dream it so?Or am I mad, hearing him talk of JulietTo think it was so? O, give me thy hand,One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makesThis vault a feasting presence full of light.Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.[Lays him in the tomb.]How oft when men are at the point of deathHave they been merry! which their keepers callA lightning before death. O, how may ICall this a lightning? O my love! my wife!Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yetIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,And death's pale flag is not advanced there.Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?O, what more favour can I do to theeThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twainTo sunder his that was thine enemy?Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believeThat unsubstantial Death is amorous,And that the lean abhorred monster keepsThee here in dark to be his paramour?For fear of that I still will stay with theeAnd never from this palace of dim nightDepart again. Here, here will I remainWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, hereWill I set up my everlasting restAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious starsFrom this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O youThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kissA dateless bargain to engrossing death!Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!Thou desperate pilot, now at once run onThe dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-nightHave my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,What torch is yond that vainly lends his lightTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,It burneth in the Capels' monument.Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,One that you love.Friar. Who is it?Bal. Romeo.Friar. How long hath he been there?Bal. Full half an hour.Friar. Go with me to the vault.Bal. I dare not, sir.My master knows not but I am gone hence,And fearfully did menace me with deathIf I did stay to look on his intents.Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,I dreamt my master and another fought,And that my master slew him.Friar. Romeo!Alack, alack, what blood is this which stainsThe stony entrance of this sepulchre?What mean these masterless and gory swordsTo lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hourIs guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.Juliet rises.Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?I do remember well where I should be,And there I am. Where is my Romeo?Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nestOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.A greater power than we can contradictHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of theeAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.Exit [Friar].What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly dropTo help me after? I will kiss thy lips.Haply some poison yet doth hang on themTo make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]Thy lips are warm!Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger![Snatches Romeo's dagger.]This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.[Exeunt some of the Watch.]Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,Who here hath lain this two days buried.Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;Raise up the Montagues; some others search.[Exeunt others of the Watch.]We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,But the true ground of all these piteous woesWe cannot without circumstance descry.Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.We took this mattock and this spade from himAs he was coming from this churchyard side.Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.Enter the Prince [and Attendants].Prince. What misadventure is so early up,That calls our person from our morning rest?Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,With open outcry, toward our monument.Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,Warm and new kill'd.Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,With instruments upon them fit to openThese dead men's tombs.Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his houseIs empty on the back of Montague,And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bellThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.Enter Montague [and others].Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early upTo see thy son and heir more early down.Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.What further woe conspires against mine age?Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,To press before thy father to a grave?Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,Till we can clear these ambiguitiesAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent;And then will I be general of your woesAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,And let mischance be slave to patience.Bring forth the parties of suspicion.Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,Yet most suspected, as the time and placeDoth make against me, of this direful murther;And here I stand, both to impeach and purgeMyself condemned and myself excus'd.Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breathIs not so long as is a tedious tale.Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.I married them; and their stol'n marriage dayWas Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely deathBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.You, to remove that siege of grief from her,Betroth'd and would have married her perforceTo County Paris. Then comes she to meAnd with wild looks bid me devise some meanTo rid her from this second marriage,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)A sleeping potion; which so took effectAs I intended, for it wrought on herThe form of death. Meantime I writ to RomeoThat he should hither come as this dire nightTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,Being the time the potion's force should cease.But he which bore my letter, Friar John,Was stay'd by accident, and yesternightReturn'd my letter back. Then all aloneAt the prefixed hour of her wakingCame I to take her from her kindred's vault;Meaning to keep her closely at my cellTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.But when I came, some minute ere the timeOf her awaking, here untimely layThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.She wakes; and I entreated her come forthAnd bear this work of heaven with patience;But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,And she, too desperate, would not go with me,But, as it seems, did violence on herself.All this I know, and to the marriageHer nurse is privy; and if aught in thisMiscarried by my fault, let my old lifeBe sacrific'd, some hour before his time,Unto the rigour of severest law.Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;And then in post he came from MantuaTo this same place, to this same monument.This letter he early bid me give his father,And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,If I departed not and left him there.Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?Sirrah, what made your master in this place?Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;And by-and-by my master drew on him;And then I ran away to call the watch.Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,Their course of love, the tidings of her death;And here he writes that he did buy a poisonOf a poor pothecary, and therewithalCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!And I, for winking at you, discords too,Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.This is my daughter's jointure, for no moreCan I demand.Mon. But I can give thee more;For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,That whiles Verona by that name is known,There shall no figure at such rate be setAs that of true and faithful Juliet.Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-Poor sacrifices of our enmity!Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.The sun for sorrow will not show his head.Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;For never was a story of more woeThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.Exeunt omnes.THE ENDOthello, the Moore of VeniceACT ISCENE I. Venice. A street.Enter RODERIGO and IAGORODERIGOTush! never tell me; I take it much unkindlyThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purseAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.IAGO'Sblood, but you will not hear me:If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.RODERIGOThou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.IAGODespise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,Evades them, with a bombast circumstanceHorribly stuff'd with epithets of war;And, in conclusion,Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,'I have already chose my officer.'And what was he?Forsooth, a great arithmetician,One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;That never set a squadron in the field,Nor the division of a battle knowsMore than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,Wherein the toged consuls can proposeAs masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proofAt Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other groundsChristian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'dBy debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.RODERIGOBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.IAGOWhy, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,Preferment goes by letter and affection,And not by old gradation, where each secondStood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,Whether I in any just term am affinedTo love the Moor.RODERIGOI would not follow him then.IAGOO, sir, content you;I follow him to serve my turn upon him:We cannot all be masters, nor all mastersCannot be truly follow'd. You shall markMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave,That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:Whip me such honest knaves. Others there areWho, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,Do well thrive by them and when they have linedtheir coatsDo themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,It is as sure as you are Roderigo,Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:In following him, I follow but myself;Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,But seeming so, for my peculiar end:For when my outward action doth demonstrateThe native act and figure of my heartIn compliment extern, 'tis not long afterBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeveFor daws to peck at: I am not what I am.RODERIGOWhat a full fortune does the thicklips oweIf he can carry't thus!IAGOCall up her father,Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,As it may lose some colour.RODERIGOHere is her father's house; I'll call aloud.IAGODo, with like timorous accent and dire yellAs when, by night and negligence, the fireIs spied in populous cities.RODERIGOWhat, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!IAGOAwake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!Thieves! thieves!BRABANTIO appears above, at a windowBRABANTIOWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?What is the matter there?RODERIGOSignior, is all your family within?IAGOAre your doors lock'd?BRABANTIOWhy, wherefore ask you this?IAGO'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put onyour gown;Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;Even now, now, very now, an old black ramIs topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:Arise, I say.BRABANTIOWhat, have you lost your wits?RODERIGOMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?BRABANTIONot I what are you?RODERIGOMy name is Roderigo.BRABANTIOThe worser welcome:I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:In honest plainness thou hast heard me sayMy daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,Being full of supper and distempering draughts,Upon malicious bravery, dost thou comeTo start my quiet.RODERIGOSir, sir, sir,--BRABANTIOBut thou must needs be sureMy spirit and my place have in them powerTo make this bitter to thee.RODERIGOPatience, good sir.BRABANTIOWhat tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;My house is not a grange.RODERIGOMost grave Brabantio,In simple and pure soul I come to you.IAGO'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will notserve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come todo you service and you think we are ruffians, you'llhave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll havecoursers for cousins and gennets for germans.BRABANTIOWhat profane wretch art thou?IAGOI am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughterand the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.BRABANTIOThou art a villain.IAGOYou are--a senator.BRABANTIOThis thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.RODERIGOSir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,Transported, with no worse nor better guardBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--If this be known to you and your allowance,We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;But if you know not this, my manners tell meWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believeThat, from the sense of all civility,I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,I say again, hath made a gross revolt;Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunesIn an extravagant and wheeling strangerOf here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:If she be in her chamber or your house,Let loose on me the justice of the stateFor thus deluding you.BRABANTIOStrike on the tinder, ho!Give me a taper! call up all my people!This accident is not unlike my dream:Belief of it oppresses me already.Light, I say! light!Exit aboveIAGOFarewell; for I must leave you:It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,However this may gall him with some cheque,Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'dWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,Another of his fathom they have none,To lead their business: in which regard,Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.Yet, for necessity of present life,I must show out a flag and sign of love,Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;And there will I be with him. So, farewell.ExitEnter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torchesBRABANTIOIt is too true an evil: gone she is;And what's to come of my despised timeIs nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives mePast thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?RODERIGOTruly, I think they are.BRABANTIOO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' mindsBy what you see them act. Is there not charmsBy which the property of youth and maidhoodMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,Of some such thing?RODERIGOYes, sir, I have indeed.BRABANTIOCall up my brother. O, would you had had her!Some one way, some another. Do you knowWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?RODERIGOI think I can discover him, if you please,To get good guard and go along with me.BRABANTIOPray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!And raise some special officers of night.On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.ExeuntSCENE II. Another street.Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torchesIAGOThough in the trade of war I have slain men,Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscienceTo do no contrived murder: I lack iniquitySometimes to do me service: nine or ten timesI had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.OTHELLO'Tis better as it is.IAGONay, but he prated,And spoke such scurvy and provoking termsAgainst your honourThat, with the little godliness I have,I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,Are you fast married?

But, look! what lights come yond?IAGOThose are the raised father and his friends:You were best go in.OTHELLONot I I must be found:My parts, my title and my perfect soulShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?IAGOBy Janus, I think no.Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torchesOTHELLOThe servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.The goodness of the night upon you, friends!What is the news?CASSIOThe duke does greet you, general,And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,Even on the instant.OTHELLOWhat is the matter, think you?CASSIOSomething from Cyprus as I may divine:It is a business of some heat: the galleysHave sent a dozen sequent messengersThis very night at one another's heels,And many of the consuls, raised and met,Are at the duke's already: you have beenhotly call'd for;When, being not at your lodging to be found,The senate hath sent about three several guestsTo search you out.OTHELLO'Tis well I am found by you.I will but spend a word here in the house,And go with you.ExitCASSIOAncient, what makes he here?IAGO'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.CASSIOI do not understand.IAGOHe's married.CASSIOTo who?Re-enter OTHELLOIAGOMarry, to--Come, captain, will you go?OTHELLOHave with you.CASSIOHere comes another troop to seek for you.IAGOIt is Brabantio. General, be advised;He comes to bad intent.Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weaponsOTHELLOHolla! stand there!RODERIGOSignior, it is the Moor.BRABANTIODown with him, thief!They draw on both sidesIAGOYou, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.OTHELLOKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.Good signior, you shall more command with yearsThan with your weapons.BRABANTIOO thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;For I'll refer me to all things of sense,If she in chains of magic were not bound,Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,So opposite to marriage that she shunnedThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,Would ever have, to incur a general mock,Run from her guardage to the sooty bosomOf such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in senseThat thou hast practised on her with foul charms,Abused her delicate youth with drugs or mineralsThat weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.I therefore apprehend and do attach theeFor an abuser of the world, a practiserOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,Subdue him at his peril.OTHELLOHold your hands,Both you of my inclining, and the rest:Were it my cue to fight, I should have known itWithout a prompter. Where will you that I goTo answer this your charge?BRABANTIOTo prison, till fit timeOf law and course of direct sessionCall thee to answer.OTHELLOWhat if I do obey?How may the duke be therewith satisfied,Whose messengers are here about my side,Upon some present business of the stateTo bring me to him?First Officer'Tis true, most worthy signior;The duke's in council and your noble self,I am sure, is sent for.BRABANTIOHow! the duke in council!In this time of the night! Bring him away:Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,Or any of my brothers of the state,Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;For if such actions may have passage free,Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.ExeuntSCENE III. A council-chamber.The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attendingDUKE OF VENICEThere is no composition in these newsThat gives them credit.First SenatorIndeed, they are disproportion'd;My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.DUKE OF VENICEAnd mine, a hundred and forty.Second SenatorAnd mine, two hundred:But though they jump not on a just account,--As in these cases, where the aim reports,'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirmA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.DUKE OF VENICENay, it is possible enough to judgment:I do not so secure me in the error,But the main article I do approveIn fearful sense.Sailor[Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!First OfficerA messenger from the galleys.Enter a SailorDUKE OF VENICENow, what's the business?SailorThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;So was I bid report here to the stateBy Signior Angelo.DUKE OF VENICEHow say you by this change?First SenatorThis cannot be,By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,To keep us in false gaze. When we considerThe importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,And let ourselves again but understand,That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,So may he with more facile question bear it,For that it stands not in such warlike brace,But altogether lacks the abilitiesThat Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,We must not think the Turk is so unskilfulTo leave that latest which concerns him first,Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,To wake and wage a danger profitless.DUKE OF VENICENay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.First OfficerHere is more news.Enter a MessengerMessengerThe Ottomites, reverend and gracious,Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,Have there injointed them with an after fleet.First SenatorAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?MessengerOf thirty sail: and now they do restemTheir backward course, bearing with frank appearanceTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,Your trusty and most valiant servitor,With his free duty recommends you thus,And prays you to believe him.DUKE OF VENICE'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?First SenatorHe's now in Florence.DUKE OF VENICEWrite from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.First SenatorHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and OfficersDUKE OF VENICEValiant Othello, we must straight employ youAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.To BRABANTIOI did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.BRABANTIOSo did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;Neither my place nor aught I heard of businessHath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general careTake hold on me, for my particular griefIs of so flood-gate and o'erbearing natureThat it engluts and swallows other sorrowsAnd it is still itself.DUKE OF VENICEWhy, what's the matter?BRABANTIOMy daughter! O, my daughter!DUKE OF VENICE SenatorDead?BRABANTIOAy, to me;She is abused, stol'n from me, and corruptedBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;For nature so preposterously to err,Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,Sans witchcraft could not.DUKE OF VENICEWhoe'er he be that in this foul proceedingHath thus beguiled your daughter of herselfAnd you of her, the bloody book of lawYou shall yourself read in the bitter letterAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper sonStood in your action.BRABANTIOHumbly I thank your grace.Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,Your special mandate for the state-affairsHath hither brought.DUKE OF VENICE SenatorWe are very sorry for't.DUKE OF VENICE[To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?BRABANTIONothing, but this is so.OTHELLOMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,My very noble and approved good masters,That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,It is most true; true, I have married her:The very head and front of my offendingHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,Till now some nine moons wasted, they have usedTheir dearest action in the tented field,And little of this great world can I speak,More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,And therefore little shall I grace my causeIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliverOf my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,What conjuration and what mighty magic,For such proceeding I am charged withal,I won his daughter.BRABANTIOA maiden never bold;Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motionBlush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,Of years, of country, credit, every thing,To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfectThat will confess perfection so could errAgainst all rules of nature, and must be drivenTo find out practises of cunning hell,Why this should be. I therefore vouch againThat with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,Or with some dram conjured to this effect,He wrought upon her.DUKE OF VENICETo vouch this, is no proof,Without more wider and more overt testThan these thin habits and poor likelihoodsOf modern seeming do prefer against him.First SenatorBut, Othello, speak:Did you by indirect and forced coursesSubdue and poison this young maid's affections?Or came it by request and such fair questionAs soul to soul affordeth?OTHELLOI do beseech you,Send for the lady to the Sagittary,And let her speak of me before her father:If you do find me foul in her report,The trust, the office I do hold of you,Not only take away, but let your sentenceEven fall upon my life.DUKE OF VENICEFetch Desdemona hither.OTHELLOAncient, conduct them: you best know the place.Exeunt IAGO and AttendantsAnd, till she come, as truly as to heavenI do confess the vices of my blood,So justly to your grave ears I'll presentHow I did thrive in this fair lady's love,And she in mine.DUKE OF VENICESay it, Othello.OTHELLOHer father loved me; oft invited me;Still question'd me the story of my life,From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,That I have passed.I ran it through, even from my boyish days,To the very moment that he bade me tell it;Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,Of moving accidents by flood and fieldOf hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,Of being taken by the insolent foeAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thenceAnd portance in my travels' history:Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heavenIt was my hint to speak,--such was the process;And of the Cannibals that each other eat,The Anthropophagi and men whose headsDo grow beneath their shoulders. This to hearWould Desdemona seriously incline:But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,She'ld come again, and with a greedy earDevour up my discourse: which I observing,Took once a pliant hour, and found good meansTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heartThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,Whereof by parcels she had something heard,But not intentively: I did consent,And often did beguile her of her tears,When I did speak of some distressful strokeThat my youth suffer'd. My story being done,She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'dThat heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,I should but teach him how to tell my story.And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,And I loved her that she did pity them.This only is the witchcraft I have used:Here comes the lady; let her witness it.Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and AttendantsDUKE OF VENICEI think this tale would win my daughter too.Good Brabantio,Take up this mangled matter at the best:Men do their broken weapons rather useThan their bare hands.BRABANTIOI pray you, hear her speak:If she confess that she was half the wooer,Destruction on my head, if my bad blameLight on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:Do you perceive in all this noble companyWhere most you owe obedience?DESDEMONAMy noble father,I do perceive here a divided duty:To you I am bound for life and education;My life and education both do learn meHow to respect you; you are the lord of duty;I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,And so much duty as my mother show'dTo you, preferring you before her father,So much I challenge that I may professDue to the Moor my lord.BRABANTIOGod be wi' you! I have done.Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:I had rather to adopt a child than get it.Come hither, Moor:I here do give thee that with all my heartWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heartI would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,I am glad at soul I have no other child:For thy escape would teach me tyranny,To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.DUKE OF VENICELet me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,Which, as a grise or step, may help these loversInto your favour.When remedies are past, the griefs are endedBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.To mourn a mischief that is past and goneIs the next way to draw new mischief on.What cannot be preserved when fortune takesPatience her injury a mockery makes.The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.BRABANTIOSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;We lose it not, so long as we can smile.He bears the sentence well that nothing bearsBut the free comfort which from thence he hears,But he bears both the sentence and the sorrowThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:But words are words; I never yet did hearThat the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.DUKE OF VENICEThe Turk with a most mighty preparation makes forCyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is bestknown to you; and though we have there a substituteof most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, asovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safervoice on you: you must therefore be content toslubber the gloss of your new fortunes with thismore stubborn and boisterous expedition.OTHELLOThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,Hath made the flinty and steel couch of warMy thrice-driven bed of down: I do agniseA natural and prompt alacrityI find in hardness, and do undertakeThese present wars against the Ottomites.Most humbly therefore bending to your state,I crave fit disposition for my wife.Due reference of place and exhibition,With such accommodation and besortAs levels with her breeding.DUKE OF VENICEIf you please,Be't at her father's.BRABANTIOI'll not have it so.OTHELLONor I.DESDEMONANor I; I would not there reside,To put my father in impatient thoughtsBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;And let me find a charter in your voice,To assist my simpleness.DUKE OF VENICEWhat would You, Desdemona?DESDEMONAThat I did love the Moor to live with him,My downright violence and storm of fortunesMay trumpet to the world: my heart's subduedEven to the very quality of my lord:I saw Othello's visage in his mind,And to his honour and his valiant partsDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,A moth of peace, and he go to the war,The rites for which I love him are bereft me,And I a heavy interim shall supportBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.OTHELLOLet her have your voices.Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,To please the palate of my appetite,Nor to comply with heat--the young affectsIn me defunct--and proper satisfaction.But to be free and bounteous to her mind:And heaven defend your good souls, that you thinkI will your serious and great business scantFor she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toysOf feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullnessMy speculative and officed instruments,That my disports corrupt and taint my business,Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,And all indign and base adversitiesMake head against my estimation!DUKE OF VENICEBe it as you shall privately determine,Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,And speed must answer it.First SenatorYou must away to-night.OTHELLOWith all my heart.DUKE OF VENICEAt nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.Othello, leave some officer behind,And he shall our commission bring to you;With such things else of quality and respectAs doth import you.OTHELLOSo please your grace, my ancient;A man he is of honest and trust:To his conveyance I assign my wife,With what else needful your good grace shall thinkTo be sent after me.DUKE OF VENICELet it be so.Good night to every one.To BRABANTIOAnd, noble signior,If virtue no delighted beauty lack,Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.First SenatorAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.BRABANTIOLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:She has deceived her father, and may thee.Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, & cOTHELLOMy life upon her faith! Honest Iago,My Desdemona must I leave to thee:I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:And bring them after in the best advantage.Come, Desdemona: I have but an hourOf love, of worldly matters and direction,To spend with thee: we must obey the time.Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONARODERIGOIago,--IAGOWhat say'st thou, noble heart?RODERIGOWhat will I do, thinkest thou?IAGOWhy, go to bed, and sleep.RODERIGOI will incontinently drown myself.IAGOIf thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,thou silly gentleman!RODERIGOIt is silliness to live when to live is torment; andthen have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.IAGOO villainous! I have looked upon the world for fourtimes seven years; and since I could distinguishbetwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found manthat knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, Iwould drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, Iwould change my humanity with a baboon.RODERIGOWhat should I do? I confess it is my shame to be sofond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.IAGOVirtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thusor thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the whichour wills are gardeners: so that if we will plantnettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed upthyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, ordistract it with many, either to have it sterilewith idleness, or manured with industry, why, thepower and corrigible authority of this lies in ourwills. If the balance of our lives had not onescale of reason to poise another of sensuality, theblood and baseness of our natures would conduct usto most preposterous conclusions: but we havereason to cool our raging motions, our carnalstings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this thatyou call love to be a sect or scion.RODERIGOIt cannot be.IAGOIt is merely a lust of the blood and a permission ofthe will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drowncats and blind puppies. I have professed me thyfriend and I confess me knit to thy deserving withcables of perdurable toughness; I could neverbetter stead thee than now. Put money in thypurse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour withan usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. Itcannot be that Desdemona should long continue herlove to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor hehis to her: it was a violent commencement, and thoushalt see an answerable sequestration:--put butmoney in thy purse. These Moors are changeable intheir wills: fill thy purse with money:--the foodthat to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall beto him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She mustchange for youth: when she is sated with his body,she will find the error of her choice: she musthave change, she must: therefore put money in thypurse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it amore delicate way than drowning. Make all the moneythou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixtan erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian nottoo hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thoushalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox ofdrowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seekthou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy thanto be drowned and go without her.RODERIGOWilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend onthe issue?IAGOThou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have toldthee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, Ihate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath noless reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revengeagainst him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dostthyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are manyevents in the womb of time which will be delivered.Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have moreof this to-morrow. Adieu.RODERIGOWhere shall we meet i' the morning?IAGOAt my lodging.RODERIGOI'll be with thee betimes.IAGOGo to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?RODERIGOWhat say you?IAGONo more of drowning, do you hear?RODERIGOI am changed: I'll go sell all my land.ExitIAGOThus do I ever make my fool my purse:For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,If I would time expend with such a snipe.But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheetsHe has done my office: I know not if't be true;But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;The better shall my purpose work on him.Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:To get his place and to plume up my willIn double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--After some time, to abuse Othello's earThat he is too familiar with his wife.He hath a person and a smooth disposeTo be suspected, framed to make women false.The Moor is of a free and open nature,That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,And will as tenderly be led by the noseAs asses are.I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and nightMust bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.ExitACT IISCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.Enter MONTANO and two GentlemenMONTANOWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?First GentlemanNothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,Descry a sail.MONTANOMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?Second GentlemanA segregation of the Turkish fleet:For do but stand upon the foaming shore,The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,seems to cast water on the burning bear,And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:I never did like molestation viewOn the enchafed flood.MONTANOIf that the Turkish fleetBe not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:It is impossible they bear it out.Enter a third GentlemanThird GentlemanNews, lads! our wars are done.The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,That their designment halts: a noble ship of VeniceHath seen a grievous wreck and sufferanceOn most part of their fleet.MONTANOHow! is this true?Third GentlemanThe ship is here put in,A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,And is in full commission here for Cyprus.MONTANOI am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.Third GentlemanBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfortTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,And prays the Moor be safe; for they were partedWith foul and violent tempest.MONTANOPray heavens he be;For I have served him, and the man commandsLike a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!As well to see the vessel that's come inAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,Even till we make the main and the aerial blueAn indistinct regard.Third GentlemanCome, let's do so:For every minute is expectancyOf more arrivance.Enter CASSIOCASSIOThanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavensGive him defence against the elements,For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.MONTANOIs he well shipp'd?CASSIOHis bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilotOf very expert and approved allowance;Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,Stand in bold cure.A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'Enter a fourth GentlemanCASSIOWhat noise?Fourth GentlemanThe town is empty; on the brow o' the seaStand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'CASSIOMy hopes do shape him for the governor.Guns heardSecond GentlemenThey do discharge their shot of courtesy:Our friends at least.CASSIOI pray you, sir, go forth,And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.Second GentlemanI shall.ExitMONTANOBut, good lieutenant, is your general wived?CASSIOMost fortunately: he hath achieved a maidThat paragons description and wild fame;One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,And in the essential vesture of creationDoes tire the ingener.Re-enter second GentlemanHow now! who has put in?Second Gentleman'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.CASSIOHas had most favourable and happy speed:Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--As having sense of beauty, do omitTheir mortal natures, letting go safely byThe divine Desdemona.MONTANOWhat is she?CASSIOShe that I spake of, our great captain's captain,Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,Whose footing here anticipates our thoughtsA se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,Give renew'd fire to our extincted spiritsAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and AttendantsO, behold,The riches of the ship is come on shore!Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,Before, behind thee, and on every hand,Enwheel thee round!DESDEMONAI thank you, valiant Cassio.What tidings can you tell me of my lord?CASSIOHe is not yet arrived: nor know I aughtBut that he's well and will be shortly here.DESDEMONAO, but I fear--How lost you company?CASSIOThe great contention of the sea and skiesParted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heardSecond GentlemanThey give their greeting to the citadel;This likewise is a friend.CASSIOSee for the news.Exit GentlemanGood ancient, you are welcome.To EMILIAWelcome, mistress.Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,That I extend my manners; 'tis my breedingThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.Kissing herIAGOSir, would she give you so much of her lipsAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,You'll have enough.DESDEMONAAlas, she has no speech.IAGOIn faith, too much;I find it still, when I have list to sleep:Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,She puts her tongue a little in her heart,And chides with thinking.EMILIAYou have little cause to say so.IAGOCome on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.DESDEMONAO, fie upon thee, slanderer!IAGONay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:You rise to play and go to bed to work.EMILIAYou shall not write my praise.IAGONo, let me not.DESDEMONAWhat wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldstpraise me?IAGOO gentle lady, do not put me to't;For I am nothing, if not critical.DESDEMONACome on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?IAGOAy, madam.DESDEMONAI am not merry; but I do beguileThe thing I am, by seeming otherwise.Come, how wouldst thou praise me?IAGOI am about it; but indeed my inventionComes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,And thus she is deliver'd.If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,The one's for use, the other useth it.DESDEMONAWell praised! How if she be black and witty?IAGOIf she be black, and thereto have a wit,She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.DESDEMONAWorse and worse.EMILIAHow if fair and foolish?IAGOShe never yet was foolish that was fair;For even her folly help'd her to an heir.DESDEMONAThese are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou forher that's foul and foolish?IAGOThere's none so foul and foolish thereunto,But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.DESDEMONAO heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deservingwoman indeed, one that, in the authority of hermerit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?IAGOShe that was ever fair and never proud,Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,She that in wisdom never was so frailTo change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,See suitors following and not look behind,She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--DESDEMONATo do what?IAGOTo suckle fools and chronicle small beer.DESDEMONAO most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learnof him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How sayyou, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberalcounsellor?CASSIOHe speaks home, madam: You may relish him more inthe soldier than in the scholar.IAGO[Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,whisper: with as little a web as this will Iensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile uponher, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks asthese strip you out of your lieutenantry, it hadbeen better you had not kissed your three fingers sooft, which now again you are most apt to play thesir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellentcourtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingersto your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!Trumpet withinThe Moor!

O my soul's joy!If after every tempest come such calms,May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!And let the labouring bark climb hills of seasOlympus-high and duck again as lowAs hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,My soul hath her content so absoluteThat not another comfort like to thisSucceeds in unknown fate.DESDEMONAThe heavens forbidBut that our loves and comforts should increase,Even as our days do grow!OTHELLOAmen to that, sweet powers!I cannot speak enough of this content;It stops me here; it is too much of joy:And this, and this, the greatest discords beKissing herThat e'er our hearts shall make!IAGO[Aside] O, you are well tuned now!But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,As honest as I am.OTHELLOCome, let us to the castle.News, friends; our wars are done, the Turksare drown'd.How does my old acquaintance of this isle?Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,I prattle out of fashion, and I doteIn mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:Bring thou the master to the citadel;He is a good one, and his worthinessDoes challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,Once more, well met at Cyprus.Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and AttendantsIAGODo thou meet me presently at the harbour. Comehither.

Thelieutenant tonight watches on the court ofguard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona isdirectly in love with him.RODERIGOWith him! why, 'tis not possible.IAGOLay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:and will she love him still for prating? let notthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;and what delight shall she have to look on thedevil? When the blood is made dull with the act ofsport, there should be, again to inflame it and togive satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all whichthe Moor is defective in: now, for want of theserequired conveniences, her delicate tenderness willfind itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature willinstruct her in it and compel her to some secondchoice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a mostpregnant and unforced position--who stands soeminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassiodoes? a knave very voluble; no furtherconscionable than in putting on the mere form ofcivil and humane seeming, for the better compassingof his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, afinder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp andcounterfeit advantages, though true advantage neverpresent itself; a devilish knave. Besides, theknave is handsome, young, and hath all thoserequisites in him that folly and green minds lookafter: a pestilent complete knave; and the womanhath found him already.RODERIGOI cannot believe that in her; she's full ofmost blessed condition.IAGOBlessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made ofgrapes: if she had been blessed, she would neverhave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thounot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didstnot mark that?RODERIGOYes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.IAGOLechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologueto the history of lust and foul thoughts. They metso near with their lips that their breaths embracedtogether. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when thesemutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comesthe master and main exercise, the incorporateconclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: Ihave brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knowsyou not. I'll not be far from you: do you findsome occasion to anger Cassio, either by speakingtoo loud, or tainting his discipline; or from whatother course you please, which the time shall morefavourably minister.RODERIGOWell.IAGOSir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haplymay strike at you: provoke him, that he may; foreven out of that will I cause these of Cyprus tomutiny; whose qualification shall come into no truetaste again but by the displanting of Cassio. Soshall you have a shorter journey to your desires bythe means I shall then have to prefer them; and theimpediment most profitably removed, without thewhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.RODERIGOI will do this, if I can bring it to anyopportunity.IAGOI warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.RODERIGOAdieu.ExitIAGOThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,And I dare think he'll prove to DesdemonaA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;Not out of absolute lust, though peradventureI stand accountant for as great a sin,But partly led to diet my revenge,For that I do suspect the lusty MoorHath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereofDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;And nothing can or shall content my soulTill I am even'd with him, wife for wife,Or failing so, yet that I put the MoorAt least into a jealousy so strongThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trashFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.For making him egregiously an assAnd practising upon his peace and quietEven to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.ExitSCENE II. A street.Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People followingHeraldIt is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiantgeneral, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,some to make bonfires, each man to what sport andrevels his addiction leads him: for, besides thesebeneficial news, it is the celebration of hisnuptial. So much was his pleasure should beproclaimed. All offices are open, and there is fullliberty of feasting from this present hour of fivetill the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless theisle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!ExeuntSCENE III. A hall in the castle.Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and AttendantsOTHELLOGood Michael, look you to the guard to-night:Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,Not to outsport discretion.CASSIOIago hath direction what to do;But, notwithstanding, with my personal eyeWill I look to't.OTHELLOIago is most honest.Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliestLet me have speech with you.To DESDEMONACome, my dear love,The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.Good night.Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and AttendantsEnter IAGOCASSIOWelcome, Iago; we must to the watch.IAGONot this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' theclock. Our general cast us thus early for the loveof his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; andshe is sport for Jove.CASSIOShe's a most exquisite lady.IAGOAnd, I'll warrant her, fun of game.CASSIOIndeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.IAGOWhat an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley ofprovocation.CASSIOAn inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.IAGOAnd when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?CASSIOShe is indeed perfection.IAGOWell, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, Ihave a stoup of wine; and here without are a braceof Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure tothe health of black Othello.CASSIONot to-night, good Iago: I have very poor andunhappy brains for drinking: I could well wishcourtesy would invent some other custom ofentertainment.IAGOO, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink foryou.CASSIOI have drunk but one cup to-night, and that wascraftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovationit makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,and dare not task my weakness with any more.IAGOWhat, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallantsdesire it.CASSIOWhere are they?IAGOHere at the door; I pray you, call them in.CASSIOI'll do't; but it dislikes me.ExitIAGOIf I can fasten but one cup upon him,With that which he hath drunk to-night already,He'll be as full of quarrel and offenceAs my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,To Desdemona hath to-night carousedPotations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,That hold their honours in a wary distance,The very elements of this warlike isle,Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,Am I to put our Cassio in some actionThat may offend the isle.--But here they come:If consequence do but approve my dream,My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wineCASSIO'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.MONTANOGood faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I ama soldier.IAGOSome wine, ho!SingsAnd let me the canakin clink, clink;And let me the canakin clinkA soldier's a man;A life's but a span;Why, then, let a soldier drink.Some wine, boys!CASSIO'Fore God, an excellent song.IAGOI learned it in England, where, indeed, they aremost potent in potting: your Dane, your German, andyour swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothingto your English.CASSIOIs your Englishman so expert in his drinking?IAGOWhy, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane deaddrunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; hegives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottlecan be filled.CASSIOTo the health of our general!MONTANOI am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.IAGOO sweet England!King Stephen was a worthy peer,His breeches cost him but a crown;He held them sixpence all too dear,With that he call'd the tailor lown.He was a wight of high renown,And thou art but of low degree:'Tis pride that pulls the country down;Then take thine auld cloak about thee.Some wine, ho!CASSIOWhy, this is a more exquisite song than the other.IAGOWill you hear't again?CASSIONo; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place thatdoes those things. Well, God's above all; and therebe souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.IAGOIt's true, good lieutenant.CASSIOFor mine own part,--no offence to the general, norany man of quality,--I hope to be saved.IAGOAnd so do I too, lieutenant.CASSIOAy, but, by your leave, not before me; thelieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let'shave no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgiveus our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is myancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, andspeak well enough.AllExcellent well.CASSIOWhy, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.ExitMONTANOTo the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.IAGOYou see this fellow that is gone before;He is a soldier fit to stand by CaesarAnd give direction: and do but see his vice;'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.I fear the trust Othello puts him in.On some odd time of his infirmity,Will shake this island.MONTANOBut is he often thus?IAGO'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:He'll watch the horologe a double set,If drink rock not his cradle.MONTANOIt were wellThe general were put in mind of it.Perhaps he sees it not; or his good naturePrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,And looks not on his evils: is not this true?Enter RODERIGOIAGO[Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.Exit RODERIGOMONTANOAnd 'tis great pity that the noble MoorShould hazard such a place as his own secondWith one of an ingraft infirmity:It were an honest action to saySo to the Moor.IAGONot I, for this fair island:I do love Cassio well; and would do muchTo cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?Cry within: 'Help! help!'Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGOCASSIOYou rogue! you rascal!MONTANOWhat's the matter, lieutenant?CASSIOA knave teach me my duty!I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.RODERIGOBeat me!CASSIODost thou prate, rogue?Striking RODERIGOMONTANONay, good lieutenant;Staying himI pray you, sir, hold your hand.CASSIOLet me go, sir,Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.MONTANOCome, come,you're drunk.CASSIODrunk!They fightIAGO[Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.Exit RODERIGONay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!Bell ringsWho's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!You will be shamed for ever.Re-enter OTHELLO and AttendantsOTHELLOWhat is the matter here?MONTANO'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.FaintsOTHELLOHold, for your lives!IAGOHold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!OTHELLOWhy, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do thatWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:He that stirs next to carve for his own rageHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isleFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.IAGOI do not know: friends all but now, even now,In quarter, and in terms like bride and groomDevesting them for bed; and then, but now--As if some planet had unwitted men--Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,In opposition bloody. I cannot speakAny beginning to this peevish odds;And would in action glorious I had lostThose legs that brought me to a part of it!OTHELLOHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?CASSIOI pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.OTHELLOWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil;The gravity and stillness of your youthThe world hath noted, and your name is greatIn mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,That you unlace your reputation thusAnd spend your rich opinion for the nameOf a night-brawler? give me answer to it.MONTANOWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--While I spare speech, which something nowoffends me,--Of all that I do know: nor know I aughtBy me that's said or done amiss this night;Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,And to defend ourselves it be a sinWhen violence assails us.OTHELLONow, by heaven,My blood begins my safer guides to rule;And passion, having my best judgment collied,Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,Or do but lift this arm, the best of youShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to knowHow this foul rout began, who set it on;And he that is approved in this offence,Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,To manage private and domestic quarrel,In night, and on the court and guard of safety!'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?MONTANOIf partially affined, or leagued in office,Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,Thou art no soldier.IAGOTouch me not so near:I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouthThan it should do offence to Michael Cassio;Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truthShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.Montano and myself being in speech,There comes a fellow crying out for help:And Cassio following him with determined sword,To execute upon him. Sir, this gentlemanSteps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:Myself the crying fellow did pursue,Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,Outran my purpose; and I return'd the ratherFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords,And Cassio high in oath; which till to-nightI ne'er might say before. When I came back--For this was brief--I found them close together,At blow and thrust; even as again they wereWhen you yourself did part them.More of this matter cannot I report:But men are men; the best sometimes forget:Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,As men in rage strike those that wish them best,Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receivedFrom him that fled some strange indignity,Which patience could not pass.OTHELLOI know, Iago,Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love theeBut never more be officer of mine.Re-enter DESDEMONA, attendedLook, if my gentle love be not raised up!I'll make thee an example.DESDEMONAWhat's the matter?OTHELLOAll's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:Lead him off.To MONTANO, who is led offIago, look with care about the town,And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' lifeTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIOIAGOWhat, are you hurt, lieutenant?CASSIOAy, past all surgery.IAGOMarry, heaven forbid!CASSIOReputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lostmy reputation! I have lost the immortal part ofmyself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,Iago, my reputation!IAGOAs I am an honest man, I thought you had receivedsome bodily wound; there is more sense in that thanin reputation. Reputation is an idle and most falseimposition: oft got without merit, and lost withoutdeserving: you have lost no reputation at all,unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!there are ways to recover the general again: youare but now cast in his mood, a punishment more inpolicy than in malice, even so as one would beat hisoffenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sueto him again, and he's yours.CASSIOI will rather sue to be despised than to deceive sogood a commander with so slight, so drunken, and soindiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?and squabble? swagger? swear? and discoursefustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisiblespirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,let us call thee devil!IAGOWhat was he that you followed with your sword? Whathad he done to you?CASSIOI know not.IAGOIs't possible?CASSIOI remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that menshould put an enemy in their mouths to steal awaytheir brains! that we should, with joy, pleasancerevel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!IAGOWhy, but you are now well enough: how came you thusrecovered?CASSIOIt hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give placeto the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows meanother, to make me frankly despise myself.IAGOCome, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,the place, and the condition of this countrystands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.CASSIOI will ask him for my place again; he shall tell meI am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,such an answer would stop them all. To be now asensible man, by and by a fool, and presently abeast! O strange! Every inordinate cup isunblessed and the ingredient is a devil.IAGOCome, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.CASSIOI have well approved it, sir. I drunk!IAGOYou or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wifeis now the general: may say so in this respect, forthat he hath devoted and given up himself to thecontemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts andgraces: confess yourself freely to her; importuneher help to put you in your place again: she is ofso free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do morethan she is requested: this broken joint betweenyou and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, myfortunes against any lay worth naming, thiscrack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.CASSIOYou advise me well.IAGOI protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.CASSIOI think it freely; and betimes in the morning I willbeseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.IAGOYou are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; Imust to the watch.CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.ExitIAGOAnd what's he then that says I play the villain?When this advice is free I give and honest,Probal to thinking and indeed the courseTo win the Moor again? For 'tis most easyThe inclining Desdemona to subdueIn any honest suit: she's framed as fruitfulAs the free elements. And then for herTo win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,That she may make, unmake, do what she list,Even as her appetite shall play the godWith his weak function. How am I then a villainTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course,Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!When devils will the blackest sins put on,They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,As I do now: for whiles this honest foolPlies Desdemona to repair his fortunesAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,That she repeals him for her body's lust;And by how much she strives to do him good,She shall undo her credit with the Moor.So will I turn her virtue into pitch,And out of her own goodness make the netThat shall enmesh them all.Re-enter RODERIGOHow now, Roderigo!RODERIGOI do follow here in the chase, not like a hound thathunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money isalmost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly wellcudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shallhave so much experience for my pains, and so, withno money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.IAGOHow poor are they that have not patience!What wound did ever heal but by degrees?Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;And wit depends on dilatory time.Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:Though other things grow fair against the sun,Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:Nay, get thee gone.Exit RODERIGOTwo things are to be done:My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;I'll set her on;Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,And bring him jump when he may Cassio findSoliciting his wife: ay, that's the wayDull not device by coldness and delay.ExitACT IIISCENE I.

There's a poor pieceof gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attendsthe general's wife be stirring, tell her there'sone Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:wilt thou do this?ClownShe is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, Ishall seem to notify unto her.CASSIODo, good my friend.Exit ClownEnter IAGOIn happy time, Iago.IAGOYou have not been a-bed, then?CASSIOWhy, no; the day had brokeBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,To send in to your wife: my suit to herIs, that she will to virtuous DesdemonaProcure me some access.IAGOI'll send her to you presently;And I'll devise a mean to draw the MoorOut of the way, that your converse and businessMay be more free.CASSIOI humbly thank you for't.Exit IAGOI never knewA Florentine more kind and honest.Enter EMILIAEMILIAGood morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorryFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.The general and his wife are talking of it;And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdomHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves youAnd needs no other suitor but his likingsTo take the safest occasion by the frontTo bring you in again.CASSIOYet, I beseech you,If you think fit, or that it may be done,Give me advantage of some brief discourseWith Desdemona alone.EMILIAPray you, come in;I will bestow you where you shall have timeTo speak your bosom freely.CASSIOI am much bound to you.ExeuntSCENE II.

Do not doubt, Cassio,But I will have my lord and you againAs friendly as you were.CASSIOBounteous madam,Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,He's never any thing but your true servant.DESDEMONAI know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:You have known him long; and be you well assuredHe shall in strangeness stand no further offThan in a polite distance.CASSIOAy, but, lady,That policy may either last so long,Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,Or breed itself so out of circumstance,That, I being absent and my place supplied,My general will forget my love and service.DESDEMONADo not doubt that; before Emilia hereI give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform itTo the last article: my lord shall never rest;I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;I'll intermingle every thing he doesWith Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;For thy solicitor shall rather dieThan give thy cause away.EMILIAMadam, here comes my lord.CASSIOMadam, I'll take my leave.DESDEMONAWhy, stay, and hear me speak.CASSIOMadam, not now: I am very ill at ease,Unfit for mine own purposes.DESDEMONAWell, do your discretion.Exit CASSIOEnter OTHELLO and IAGOIAGOHa! I like not that.OTHELLOWhat dost thou say?IAGONothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.OTHELLOWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?IAGOCassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,That he would steal away so guilty-like,Seeing you coming.OTHELLOI do believe 'twas he.DESDEMONAHow now, my lord!I have been talking with a suitor here,A man that languishes in your displeasure.OTHELLOWho is't you mean?DESDEMONAWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,If I have any grace or power to move you,His present reconciliation take;For if he be not one that truly loves you,That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,I have no judgment in an honest face:I prithee, call him back.OTHELLOWent he hence now?DESDEMONAAy, sooth; so humbledThat he hath left part of his grief with me,To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.OTHELLONot now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.DESDEMONABut shall't be shortly?OTHELLOThe sooner, sweet, for you.DESDEMONAShall't be to-night at supper?OTHELLONo, not to-night.DESDEMONATo-morrow dinner, then?OTHELLOI shall not dine at home;I meet the captains at the citadel.DESDEMONAWhy, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:I prithee, name the time, but let it notExceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;And yet his trespass, in our common reason--Save that, they say, the wars must make examplesOut of their best--is not almost a faultTo incur a private cheque. When shall he come?Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,What you would ask me, that I should deny,Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to doTo bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--OTHELLOPrithee, no more: let him come when he will;I will deny thee nothing.DESDEMONAWhy, this is not a boon;'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,Or sue to you to do a peculiar profitTo your own person: nay, when I have a suitWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,It shall be full of poise and difficult weightAnd fearful to be granted.OTHELLOI will deny thee nothing:Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,To leave me but a little to myself.DESDEMONAShall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.OTHELLOFarewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.DESDEMONAEmilia, come.

Perdition catch my soul,But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,Chaos is come again.IAGOMy noble lord--OTHELLOWhat dost thou say, Iago?IAGODid Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,Know of your love?OTHELLOHe did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?IAGOBut for a satisfaction of my thought;No further harm.OTHELLOWhy of thy thought, Iago?IAGOI did not think he had been acquainted with her.OTHELLOO, yes; and went between us very oft.IAGOIndeed!OTHELLOIndeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?Is he not honest?IAGOHonest, my lord!OTHELLOHonest! ay, honest.IAGOMy lord, for aught I know.OTHELLOWhat dost thou think?IAGOThink, my lord!OTHELLOThink, my lord!By heaven, he echoes me,As if there were some monster in his thoughtToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?And when I told thee he was of my counselIn my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'And didst contract and purse thy brow together,As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brainSome horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,Show me thy thought.IAGOMy lord, you know I love you.OTHELLOI think thou dost;And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:For such things in a false disloyal knaveAre tricks of custom, but in a man that's justThey are close delations, working from the heartThat passion cannot rule.IAGOFor Michael Cassio,I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.OTHELLOI think so too.IAGOMen should be what they seem;Or those that be not, would they might seem none!OTHELLOCertain, men should be what they seem.IAGOWhy, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.OTHELLONay, yet there's more in this:I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughtsThe worst of words.IAGOGood my lord, pardon me:Though I am bound to every act of duty,I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;As where's that palace whereinto foul thingsSometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,But some uncleanly apprehensionsKeep leets and law-days and in session sitWith meditations lawful?OTHELLOThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his earA stranger to thy thoughts.IAGOI do beseech you--Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,As, I confess, it is my nature's plagueTo spy into abuses, and oft my jealousyShapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,From one that so imperfectly conceits,Would take no notice, nor build yourself a troubleOut of his scattering and unsure observance.It were not for your quiet nor your good,Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,To let you know my thoughts.OTHELLOWhat dost thou mean?IAGOGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,Is the immediate jewel of their souls:Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:But he that filches from me my good nameRobs me of that which not enriches himAnd makes me poor indeed.OTHELLOBy heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.IAGOYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand;Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.OTHELLOHa!IAGOO, beware, my lord, of jealousy;It is the green-eyed monster which doth mockThe meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in blissWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'erWho dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!OTHELLOO misery!IAGOPoor and content is rich and rich enough,But riches fineless is as poor as winterTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defendFrom jealousy!OTHELLOWhy, why is this?Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,To follow still the changes of the moonWith fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubtIs once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,When I shall turn the business of my soulTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealousTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:Nor from mine own weak merits will I drawThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;And on the proof, there is no more but this,--Away at once with love or jealousy!IAGOI am glad of it; for now I shall have reasonTo show the love and duty that I bear youWith franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:I would not have your free and noble nature,Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:I know our country disposition well;In Venice they do let heaven see the pranksThey dare not show their husbands; their best conscienceIs not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.OTHELLODost thou say so?IAGOShe did deceive her father, marrying you;And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,She loved them most.OTHELLOAnd so she did.IAGOWhy, go to then;She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;I humbly do beseech you of your pardonFor too much loving you.OTHELLOI am bound to thee for ever.IAGOI see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.OTHELLONot a jot, not a jot.IAGOI' faith, I fear it has.I hope you will consider what is spokeComes from my love. But I do see you're moved:I am to pray you not to strain my speechTo grosser issues nor to larger reachThan to suspicion.OTHELLOI will not.IAGOShould you do so, my lord,My speech should fall into such vile successAs my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--My lord, I see you're moved.OTHELLONo, not much moved:I do not think but Desdemona's honest.IAGOLong live she so! and long live you to think so!OTHELLOAnd yet, how nature erring from itself,--IAGOAy, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--Not to affect many proposed matchesOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,Whereto we see in all things nature tends--Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.But pardon me; I do not in positionDistinctly speak of her; though I may fearHer will, recoiling to her better judgment,May fall to match you with her country formsAnd happily repent.OTHELLOFarewell, farewell:If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:IAGO[Going] My lord, I take my leave.OTHELLOWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtlessSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.IAGO[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreatyour honourTo scan this thing no further; leave it to time:Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,For sure, he fills it up with great ability,Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,You shall by that perceive him and his means:Note, if your lady strain his entertainmentWith any strong or vehement importunity;Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,Let me be thought too busy in my fears--As worthy cause I have to fear I am--And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.OTHELLOFear not my government.IAGOI once more take my leave.ExitOTHELLOThis fellow's of exceeding honesty,And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am blackAnd have not those soft parts of conversationThat chamberers have, or for I am declinedInto the vale of years,--yet that's not much--She's gone. I am abused; and my reliefMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,That we can call these delicate creatures ours,And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,Than keep a corner in the thing I loveFor others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;Prerogatived are they less than the base;'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:Even then this forked plague is fated to usWhen we do quicken. Desdemona comes:Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIAIf she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!I'll not believe't.DESDEMONAHow now, my dear Othello!Your dinner, and the generous islandersBy you invited, do attend your presence.OTHELLOI am to blame.DESDEMONAWhy do you speak so faintly?Are you not well?OTHELLOI have a pain upon my forehead here.DESDEMONA'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:Let me but bind it hard, within this hourIt will be well.OTHELLOYour napkin is too little:He puts the handkerchief from him; and it dropsLet it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.DESDEMONAI am very sorry that you are not well.Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONAEMILIAI am glad I have found this napkin:This was her first remembrance from the Moor:My wayward husband hath a hundred timesWoo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,For he conjured her she should ever keep it,That she reserves it evermore about herTo kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,And give't Iago: what he will do with itHeaven knows, not I;I nothing but to please his fantasy.Re-enter IagoIAGOHow now! what do you here alone?EMILIADo not you chide; I have a thing for you.IAGOA thing for me? it is a common thing--EMILIAHa!IAGOTo have a foolish wife.EMILIAO, is that all? What will you give me nowFor the same handkerchief?IAGOWhat handkerchief?EMILIAWhat handkerchief?Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;That which so often you did bid me steal.IAGOHast stol'n it from her?EMILIANo, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.Look, here it is.IAGOA good wench; give it me.EMILIAWhat will you do with 't, that you have beenso earnestTo have me filch it?IAGO[Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?EMILIAIf it be not for some purpose of import,Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run madWhen she shall lack it.IAGOBe not acknown on 't; I have use for it.Go, leave me.Exit EMILIAI will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,And let him find it. Trifles light as airAre to the jealous confirmations strongAs proofs of holy writ: this may do something.The Moor already changes with my poison:Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,But with a little act upon the blood.Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:Look, where he comes!Re-enter OTHELLONot poppy, nor mandragora,Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleepWhich thou owedst yesterday.OTHELLOHa! ha! false to me?IAGOWhy, how now, general! no more of that.OTHELLOAvaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:I swear 'tis better to be much abusedThan but to know't a little.IAGOHow now, my lord!OTHELLOWhat sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:I slept the next night well, was free and merry;I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.IAGOI am sorry to hear this.OTHELLOI had been happy, if the general camp,Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,So I had nothing known. O, now, for everFarewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,The royal banner, and all quality,Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throatsThe immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!IAGOIs't possible, my lord?OTHELLOVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,Thou hadst been better have been born a dogThan answer my waked wrath!IAGOIs't come to this?OTHELLOMake me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,That the probation bear no hinge nor loopTo hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!IAGOMy noble lord,--OTHELLOIf thou dost slander her and torture me,Never pray more; abandon all remorse;On horror's head horrors accumulate;Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;For nothing canst thou to damnation addGreater than that.IAGOO grace! O heaven forgive me!Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.That livest to make thine honesty a vice!O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,To be direct and honest is not safe.I thank you for this profit; and from henceI'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.OTHELLONay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.IAGOI should be wise, for honesty's a foolAnd loses that it works for.OTHELLOBy the world,I think my wife be honest and think she is not;I think that thou art just and think thou art not.I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as freshAs Dian's visage, is now begrimed and blackAs mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!IAGOI see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:I do repent me that I put it to you.You would be satisfied?OTHELLOWould! nay, I will.IAGOAnd may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--Behold her topp'd?OTHELLODeath and damnation! O!IAGOIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,If ever mortal eyes do see them bolsterMore than their own! What then? how then?What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?It is impossible you should see this,Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as grossAs ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,If imputation and strong circumstances,Which lead directly to the door of truth,Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.OTHELLOGive me a living reason she's disloyal.IAGOI do not like the office:But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;And, being troubled with a raging tooth,I could not sleep.There are a kind of men so loose of soul,That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:One of this kind is Cassio:In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,As if he pluck'd up kisses by the rootsThat grew upon my lips: then laid his legOver my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and thenCried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'OTHELLOO monstrous! monstrous!IAGONay, this was but his dream.OTHELLOBut this denoted a foregone conclusion:'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.IAGOAnd this may help to thicken other proofsThat do demonstrate thinly.OTHELLOI'll tear her all to pieces.IAGONay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchiefSpotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?OTHELLOI gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.IAGOI know not that; but such a handkerchief--I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-daySee Cassio wipe his beard with.OTHELLOIf it be that--IAGOIf it be that, or any that was hers,It speaks against her with the other proofs.OTHELLOO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.'Tis gone.Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throneTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,For 'tis of aspics' tongues!IAGOYet be content.OTHELLOO, blood, blood, blood!IAGOPatience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.OTHELLONever, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,Whose icy current and compulsive courseNe'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due onTo the Propontic and the Hellespont,Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,Till that a capable and wide revengeSwallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,KneelsIn the due reverence of a sacred vowI here engage my words.IAGODo not rise yet.KneelsWitness, you ever-burning lights above,You elements that clip us round about,Witness that here Iago doth give upThe execution of his wit, hands, heart,To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,And to obey shall be in me remorse,What bloody business ever.They riseOTHELLOI greet thy love,Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,And will upon the instant put thee to't:Within these three days let me hear thee sayThat Cassio's not alive.IAGOMy friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:But let her live.OTHELLODamn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,To furnish me with some swift means of deathFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.IAGOI am your own for ever.ExeuntSCENE IV. Before the castle.Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and ClownDESDEMONADo you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?ClownI dare not say he lies any where.DESDEMONAWhy, man?ClownHe's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,is stabbing.DESDEMONAGo to: where lodges he?ClownTo tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.DESDEMONACan any thing be made of this?ClownI know not where he lodges, and for me to devise alodging and say he lies here or he lies there, wereto lie in mine own throat.DESDEMONACan you inquire him out, and be edified by report?ClownI will catechise the world for him; that is, makequestions, and by them answer.DESDEMONASeek him, bid him come hither: tell him I havemoved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.ClownTo do this is within the compass of man's wit: andtherefore I will attempt the doing it.ExitDESDEMONAWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?EMILIAI know not, madam.DESDEMONABelieve me, I had rather have lost my purseFull of crusadoes: and, but my noble MoorIs true of mind and made of no such basenessAs jealous creatures are, it were enoughTo put him to ill thinking.EMILIAIs he not jealous?DESDEMONAWho, he? I think the sun where he was bornDrew all such humours from him.EMILIALook, where he comes.DESDEMONAI will not leave him now till CassioBe call'd to him.Enter OTHELLOHow is't with you, my lordOTHELLOWell, my good lady.AsideO, hardness to dissemble!--How do you, Desdemona?DESDEMONAWell, my good lord.OTHELLOGive me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.DESDEMONAIt yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.OTHELLOThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requiresA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,Much castigation, exercise devout;For here's a young and sweating devil here,That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,A frank one.DESDEMONAYou may, indeed, say so;For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.OTHELLOA liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.DESDEMONAI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.OTHELLOWhat promise, chuck?DESDEMONAI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.OTHELLOI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;Lend me thy handkerchief.DESDEMONAHere, my lord.OTHELLOThat which I gave you.DESDEMONAI have it not about me.OTHELLONot?DESDEMONANo, indeed, my lord.OTHELLOThat is a fault.That handkerchiefDid an Egyptian to my mother give;She was a charmer, and could almost readThe thoughts of people: she told her, whileshe kept it,'Twould make her amiable and subdue my fatherEntirely to her love, but if she lost itOr made gift of it, my father's eyeShould hold her loathed and his spirits should huntAfter new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;Make it a darling like your precious eye;To lose't or give't away were such perditionAs nothing else could match.DESDEMONAIs't possible?OTHELLO'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:A sibyl, that had number'd in the worldThe sun to course two hundred compasses,In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;And it was dyed in mummy which the skilfulConserved of maidens' hearts.DESDEMONAIndeed! is't true?OTHELLOMost veritable; therefore look to't well.DESDEMONAThen would to God that I had never seen't!OTHELLOHa! wherefore?DESDEMONAWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?OTHELLOIs't lost? is't gone? speak, is it outo' the way?DESDEMONAHeaven bless us!OTHELLOSay you?DESDEMONAIt is not lost; but what an if it were?OTHELLOHow!DESDEMONAI say, it is not lost.OTHELLOFetch't, let me see't.DESDEMONAWhy, so I can, sir, but I will not now.This is a trick to put me from my suit:Pray you, let Cassio be received again.OTHELLOFetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.DESDEMONACome, come;You'll never meet a more sufficient man.OTHELLOThe handkerchief!DESDEMONAI pray, talk me of Cassio.OTHELLOThe handkerchief!DESDEMONAA man that all his timeHath founded his good fortunes on your love,Shared dangers with you,--OTHELLOThe handkerchief!DESDEMONAIn sooth, you are to blame.OTHELLOAway!ExitEMILIAIs not this man jealous?DESDEMONAI ne'er saw this before.Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:I am most unhappy in the loss of it.EMILIA'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!Enter CASSIO and IAGOIAGOThere is no other way; 'tis she must do't:And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.DESDEMONAHow now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?CASSIOMadam, my former suit: I do beseech youThat by your virtuous means I may againExist, and be a member of his loveWhom I with all the office of my heartEntirely honour: I would not be delay'd.If my offence be of such mortal kindThat nor my service past, nor present sorrows,Nor purposed merit in futurity,Can ransom me into his love again,But to know so must be my benefit;So shall I clothe me in a forced content,And shut myself up in some other course,To fortune's alms.DESDEMONAAlas, thrice-gentle Cassio!My advocation is not now in tune;My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.So help me every spirit sanctified,As I have spoken for you all my bestAnd stood within the blank of his displeasureFor my free speech! you must awhile be patient:What I can do I will; and more I willThan for myself I dare: let that suffice you.IAGOIs my lord angry?EMILIAHe went hence but now,And certainly in strange unquietness.IAGOCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon,When it hath blown his ranks into the air,And, like the devil, from his very armPuff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?Something of moment then: I will go meet him:There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.DESDEMONAI prithee, do so.Exit IAGOSomething, sure, of state,Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practiseMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such casesMen's natures wrangle with inferior things,Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;For let our finger ache, and it induesOur other healthful members even to that senseOf pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,Nor of them look for such observancesAs fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,And he's indicted falsely.EMILIAPray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,And no conception nor no jealous toyConcerning you.DESDEMONAAlas the day! I never gave him cause.EMILIABut jealous souls will not be answer'd so;They are not ever jealous for the cause,But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monsterBegot upon itself, born on itself.DESDEMONAHeaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!EMILIALady, amen.DESDEMONAI will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:If I do find him fit, I'll move your suitAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.CASSIOI humbly thank your ladyship.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIAEnter BIANCABIANCASave you, friend Cassio!CASSIOWhat make you from home?How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.BIANCAAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,More tedious than the dial eight score times?O weary reckoning!CASSIOPardon me, Bianca:I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:But I shall, in a more continuate time,Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchiefTake me this work out.BIANCAO Cassio, whence came this?This is some token from a newer friend:To the felt absence now I feel a cause:Is't come to this? Well, well.CASSIOGo to, woman!Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,From whence you have them. You are jealous nowThat this is from some mistress, some remembrance:No, in good troth, Bianca.BIANCAWhy, whose is it?CASSIOI know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.I like the work well: ere it be demanded--As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.BIANCALeave you! wherefore?CASSIOI do attend here on the general;And think it no addition, nor my wish,To have him see me woman'd.BIANCAWhy, I pray you?CASSIONot that I love you not.BIANCABut that you do not love me.I pray you, bring me on the way a little,And say if I shall see you soon at night.CASSIO'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.BIANCA'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.ExeuntACT IVSCENE I.

We say lie on her, whenthey belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--Toconfess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to behanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.Nature would not invest herself in such shadowingpassion without some instruction. It is not wordsthat shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--Falls in a tranceIAGOWork on,My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!My lord, I say! Othello!Enter CASSIOHow now, Cassio!CASSIOWhat's the matter?IAGOMy lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.CASSIORub him about the temples.IAGONo, forbear;The lethargy must have his quiet course:If not, he foams at mouth and by and byBreaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:Do you withdraw yourself a little while,He will recover straight: when he is gone,I would on great occasion speak with you.Exit CASSIOHow is it, general? have you not hurt your head?OTHELLODost thou mock me?IAGOI mock you! no, by heaven.Would you would bear your fortune like a man!OTHELLOA horned man's a monster and a beast.IAGOThere's many a beast then in a populous city,And many a civil monster.OTHELLODid he confess it?IAGOGood sir, be a man;Think every bearded fellow that's but yokedMay draw with you: there's millions now aliveThat nightly lie in those unproper bedsWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,To lip a wanton in a secure couch,And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.OTHELLOO, thou art wise; 'tis certain.IAGOStand you awhile apart;Confine yourself but in a patient list.Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--A passion most unsuiting such a man--Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,Bade him anon return and here speak with me;The which he promised.

Turn thy complexion there,Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--Ay, there, look grim as hell!DESDEMONAI hope my noble lord esteems me honest.OTHELLOO, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,That quicken even with blowing.

Those that do teach young babesDo it with gentle means and easy tasks:He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,I am a child to chiding.IAGOWhat's the matter, lady?EMILIAAlas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,As true hearts cannot bear.DESDEMONAAm I that name, Iago?IAGOWhat name, fair lady?DESDEMONASuch as she says my lord did say I was.EMILIAHe call'd her whore: a beggar in his drinkCould not have laid such terms upon his callat.IAGOWhy did he so?DESDEMONAI do not know; I am sure I am none such.IAGODo not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!EMILIAHath she forsook so many noble matches,Her father and her country and her friends,To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?DESDEMONAIt is my wretched fortune.IAGOBeshrew him for't!How comes this trick upon him?DESDEMONANay, heaven doth know.EMILIAI will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,Some busy and insinuating rogue,Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.IAGOFie, there is no such man; it is impossible.DESDEMONAIf any such there be, heaven pardon him!EMILIAA halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,And put in every honest hand a whipTo lash the rascals naked through the worldEven from the east to the west!IAGOSpeak within door.EMILIAO, fie upon them! Some such squire he wasThat turn'd your wit the seamy side without,And made you to suspect me with the Moor.IAGOYou are a fool; go to.DESDEMONAO good Iago,What shall I do to win my lord again?Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,Delighted them in any other form;Or that I do not yet, and ever did.And ever will--though he do shake me offTo beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;And his unkindness may defeat my life,But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'It does abhor me now I speak the word;To do the act that might the addition earnNot the world's mass of vanity could make me.IAGOI pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:The business of the state does him offence,And he does chide with you.DESDEMONAIf 'twere no other--IAGO'Tis but so, I warrant.Trumpets withinHark, how these instruments summon to supper!The messengers of Venice stay the meat;Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIAEnter RODERIGOHow now, Roderigo!RODERIGOI do not find that thou dealest justly with me.IAGOWhat in the contrary?RODERIGOEvery day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from meall conveniency than suppliest me with the leastadvantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endureit, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace whatalready I have foolishly suffered.IAGOWill you hear me, Roderigo?RODERIGO'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words andperformances are no kin together.IAGOYou charge me most unjustly.RODERIGOWith nought but truth. I have wasted myself out ofmy means. The jewels you have had from me todeliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted avotarist: you have told me she hath received themand returned me expectations and comforts of suddenrespect and acquaintance, but I find none.IAGOWell; go to; very well.RODERIGOVery well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tisnot very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and beginto find myself fobbed in it.IAGOVery well.RODERIGOI tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myselfknown to Desdemona: if she will return me myjewels, I will give over my suit and repent myunlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself Iwill seek satisfaction of you.IAGOYou have said now.RODERIGOAy, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.IAGOWhy, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even fromthis instant to build on thee a better opinion thanever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hasttaken against me a most just exception; but yet, Iprotest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.RODERIGOIt hath not appeared.IAGOI grant indeed it hath not appeared, and yoursuspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which Ihave greater reason to believe now than ever, I meanpurpose, courage and valour, this night show it: ifthou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,take me from this world with treachery and deviseengines for my life.RODERIGOWell, what is it? is it within reason and compass?IAGOSir, there is especial commission come from Veniceto depute Cassio in Othello's place.RODERIGOIs that true? why, then Othello and Desdemonareturn again to Venice.IAGOO, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away withhim the fair Desdemona, unless his abode belingered here by some accident: wherein none can beso determinate as the removing of Cassio.RODERIGOHow do you mean, removing of him?IAGOWhy, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;knocking out his brains.RODERIGOAnd that you would have me to do?IAGOAy, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will Igo to him: he knows not yet of his horrorablefortune. If you will watch his going thence, whichI will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,you may take him at your pleasure: I will be nearto second your attempt, and he shall fall betweenus. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along withme; I will show you such a necessity in his deaththat you shall think yourself bound to put it onhim. It is now high suppertime, and the night growsto waste: about it.RODERIGOI will hear further reason for this.IAGOAnd you shall be satisfied.ExeuntSCENE III. Another room In the castle.Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and AttendantsLODOVICOI do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.OTHELLOO, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.LODOVICOMadam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.DESDEMONAYour honour is most welcome.OTHELLOWill you walk, sir?O,--Desdemona,--DESDEMONAMy lord?OTHELLOGet you to bed on the instant; I will be returnedforthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.DESDEMONAI will, my lord.Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and AttendantsEMILIAHow goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.DESDEMONAHe says he will return incontinent:He hath commanded me to go to bed,And bade me to dismiss you.EMILIADismiss me!DESDEMONAIt was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:We must not now displease him.EMILIAI would you had never seen him!DESDEMONASo would not I my love doth so approve him,That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.EMILIAI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.DESDEMONAAll's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!If I do die before thee prithee, shroud meIn one of those same sheets.EMILIACome, come you talk.DESDEMONAMy mother had a maid call'd Barbara:She was in love, and he she loved proved madAnd did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,And she died singing it: that song to-nightWill not go from my mind; I have much to do,But to go hang my head all at one side,And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.EMILIAShall I go fetch your night-gown?DESDEMONANo, unpin me here.This Lodovico is a proper man.EMILIAA very handsome man.DESDEMONAHe speaks well.EMILIAI know a lady in Venice would have walked barefootto Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.DESDEMONA[Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,Sing all a green willow:Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,Sing willow, willow, willow:The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;Sing willow, willow, willow;Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;Lay by these:--SingingSing willow, willow, willow;Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--SingingSing all a green willow must be my garland.Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?EMILIAIt's the wind.DESDEMONA[Singing] I call'd my love false love; but whatsaid he then?Sing willow, willow, willow:If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;Doth that bode weeping?EMILIA'Tis neither here nor there.DESDEMONAI have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--That there be women do abuse their husbandsIn such gross kind?EMILIAThere be some such, no question.DESDEMONAWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?EMILIAWhy, would not you?DESDEMONANo, by this heavenly light!EMILIANor I neither by this heavenly light;I might do't as well i' the dark.DESDEMONAWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?EMILIAThe world's a huge thing: it is a great price.For a small vice.DESDEMONAIn troth, I think thou wouldst not.EMILIAIn troth, I think I should; and undo't when I haddone. Marry, I would not do such a thing for ajoint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor forgowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any pettyexhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who wouldnot make her husband a cuckold to make him amonarch? I should venture purgatory for't.DESDEMONABeshrew me, if I would do such a wrongFor the whole world.EMILIAWhy the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: andhaving the world for your labour, tis a wrong in yourown world, and you might quickly make it right.DESDEMONAI do not think there is any such woman.EMILIAYes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as wouldstore the world they played for.But I do think it is their husbands' faultsIf wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,And pour our treasures into foreign laps,Or else break out in peevish jealousies,Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,Or scant our former having in despite;Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands knowTheir wives have sense like them: they see and smellAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,As husbands have. What is it that they doWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?I think it is: and doth affection breed it?I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?It is so too: and have not we affections,Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?Then let them use us well: else let them know,The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.DESDEMONAGood night, good night: heaven me such uses send,Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!ExeuntACT VSCENE I.

O, bear him outo' the air.CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne offStay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,Though tongues were out of use.Enter EMILIAEMILIA'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?IAGOCassio hath here been set on in the darkBy Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.EMILIAAlas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!IAGOThis is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.To BIANCAWhat, do you shake at that?BIANCAHe supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.IAGOO, did he so? I charge you, go with me.EMILIAFie, fie upon thee, strumpet!BIANCAI am no strumpet; but of life as honestAs you that thus abuse me.EMILIAAs I! foh! fie upon thee!IAGOKind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.Emilia run you to the citadel,And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.Will you go on?

A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;a light burning.Enter OTHELLOOTHELLOIt is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,And smooth as monumental alabaster.Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.Put out the light, and then put out the light:If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,I can again thy former light restore,Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,I know not where is that Promethean heatThat can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,I cannot give it vital growth again.It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.Kissing herAh balmy breath, that dost almost persuadeJustice to break her sword! One more, one more.Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,And love thee after. One more, and this the last:So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.DESDEMONAWho's there? Othello?OTHELLOAy. Desdemona.DESDEMONAWill you come to bed, my lord?OTHELLOHave you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?DESDEMONAAy, my lord.OTHELLOIf you bethink yourself of any crimeUnreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,Solicit for it straight.DESDEMONAAlas, my lord, what do you mean by that?OTHELLOWell, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;No; heaven forfend!

By and by. She's dead.'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.O insupportable! O heavy hour!Methinks it should be now a huge eclipseOf sun and moon, and that the affrighted globeShould yawn at alteration.EMILIA[Within] I do beseech youThat I may speak with you, O, good my lord!OTHELLOI had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;Soft; by and by.

O!He falls on the bedEMILIANay, lay thee down and roar;For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocentThat e'er did lift up eye.OTHELLO[Rising] O, she was foul!I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:I know this act shows horrible and grim.GRATIANOPoor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:Thy match was mortal to him, and pure griefShore his old thread in twain: did he live now,This sight would make him do a desperate turn,Yea, curse his better angel from his side,And fall to reprobation.OTHELLO'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knowsThat she with Cassio hath the act of shameA thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:And she did gratify his amorous worksWith that recognizance and pledge of loveWhich I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:It was a handkerchief, an antique tokenMy father gave my mother.EMILIAO heaven! O heavenly powers!IAGOCome, hold your peace.EMILIA'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!No, I will speak as liberal as the north:Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.IAGOBe wise, and get you home.EMILIAI will not.IAGO offers to stab EMILIAGRATIANOFie!Your sword upon a woman?EMILIAO thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st ofI found by fortune and did give my husband;For often, with a solemn earnestness,More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,He begg'd of me to steal it.IAGOVillanous whore!EMILIAShe give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,And I did give't my husband.IAGOFilth, thou liest!EMILIABy heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.O murderous coxcomb! what should such a foolDo with so good a woman?OTHELLOAre there no stones in heavenBut what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exitGRATIANOThe woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.EMILIAAy, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.GRATIANOHe's gone, but his wife's kill'd.MONTANO'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,For 'tis a damned slave.Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANOOTHELLOI am not valiant neither,But ever puny whipster gets my sword:But why should honour outlive honesty?Let it go all.EMILIAWhat did thy song bode, lady?Hark, canst thou hear me?

'tis not so now.Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;Man but a rush against Othello's breast,And he retires. Where should Othello go?Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!Even like thy chastity.

Bernardo!BERNARDOSay,What, is Horatio there?HORATIOA piece of him.BERNARDOWelcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.MARCELLUSWhat, has this thing appear'd again to-night?BERNARDOI have seen nothing.MARCELLUSHoratio says 'tis but our fantasy,And will not let belief take hold of himTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:Therefore I have entreated him alongWith us to watch the minutes of this night;That if again this apparition come,He may approve our eyes and speak to it.HORATIOTush, tush, 'twill not appear.BERNARDOSit down awhile;And let us once again assail your ears,That are so fortified against our storyWhat we have two nights seen.HORATIOWell, sit we down,And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.BERNARDOLast night of all,When yond same star that's westward from the poleHad made his course to illume that part of heavenWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,The bell then beating one,--Enter GhostMARCELLUSPeace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!BERNARDOIn the same figure, like the king that's dead.MARCELLUSThou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.BERNARDOLooks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.HORATIOMost like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.BERNARDOIt would be spoke to.MARCELLUSQuestion it, Horatio.HORATIOWhat art thou that usurp'st this time of night,Together with that fair and warlike formIn which the majesty of buried DenmarkDid sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!MARCELLUSIt is offended.BERNARDOSee, it stalks away!HORATIOStay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!Exit GhostMARCELLUS'Tis gone, and will not answer.BERNARDOHow now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:Is not this something more than fantasy?What think you on't?HORATIOBefore my God, I might not this believeWithout the sensible and true avouchOf mine own eyes.MARCELLUSIs it not like the king?HORATIOAs thou art to thyself:Such was the very armour he had onWhen he the ambitious Norway combated;So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.'Tis strange.MARCELLUSThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.HORATIOIn what particular thought to work I know not;But in the gross and scope of my opinion,This bodes some strange eruption to our state.MARCELLUSGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,Why this same strict and most observant watchSo nightly toils the subject of the land,And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,And foreign mart for implements of war;Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week;What might be toward, that this sweaty hasteDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:Who is't that can inform me?HORATIOThat can I;At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,Whose image even but now appear'd to us,Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,Well ratified by law and heraldry,Did forfeit, with his life, all those his landsWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror:Against the which, a moiety competentWas gaged by our king; which had return'dTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,And carriage of the article design'd,His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,Of unimproved mettle hot and full,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and thereShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,For food and diet, to some enterpriseThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other--As it doth well appear unto our state--But to recover of us, by strong handAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid landsSo by his father lost: and this, I take it,Is the main motive of our preparations,The source of this our watch and the chief headOf this post-haste and romage in the land.BERNARDOI think it be no other but e'en so:Well may it sort that this portentous figureComes armed through our watch; so like the kingThat was and is the question of these wars.HORATIOA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.In the most high and palmy state of Rome,A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun; and the moist starUpon whose influence Neptune's empire standsWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:And even the like precurse of fierce events,As harbingers preceding still the fatesAnd prologue to the omen coming on,Have heaven and earth together demonstratedUnto our climatures and countrymen.--But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!Re-enter GhostI'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,Speak to me:If there be any good thing to be done,That may to thee do ease and grace to me,Speak to me:Cock crowsIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.MARCELLUSShall I strike at it with my partisan?HORATIODo, if it will not stand.BERNARDO'Tis here!HORATIO'Tis here!MARCELLUS'Tis gone!Exit GhostWe do it wrong, being so majestical,To offer it the show of violence;For it is, as the air, invulnerable,And our vain blows malicious mockery.BERNARDOIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.HORATIOAnd then it started like a guilty thingUpon a fearful summons. I have heard,The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throatAwake the god of day; and, at his warning,Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,The extravagant and erring spirit hiesTo his confine: and of the truth hereinThis present object made probation.MARCELLUSIt faded on the crowing of the cock.Some say that ever 'gainst that season comesWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,The bird of dawning singeth all night long:And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.HORATIOSo have I heard and do in part believe it.But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:Break we our watch up; and by my advice,Let us impart what we have seen to-nightUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?MARCELLUSLet's do't, I pray; and I this morning knowWhere we shall find him most conveniently.ExeuntSCENE II. A room of state in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and AttendantsKING CLAUDIUSThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's deathThe memory be green, and that it us befittedTo bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdomTo be contracted in one brow of woe,Yet so far hath discretion fought with natureThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,Together with remembrance of ourselves.Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,The imperial jointress to this warlike state,Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--With an auspicious and a dropping eye,With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'dYour better wisdoms, which have freely goneWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,Holding a weak supposal of our worth,Or thinking by our late dear brother's deathOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,Importing the surrender of those landsLost by his father, with all bonds of law,To our most valiant brother. So much for him.Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:Thus much the business is: we have here writTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hearsOf this his nephew's purpose,--to suppressHis further gait herein; in that the levies,The lists and full proportions, are all madeOut of his subject: and we here dispatchYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;Giving to you no further personal powerTo business with the king, more than the scopeOf these delated articles allow.Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.CORNELIUS VOLTIMANDIn that and all things will we show our duty.KING CLAUDIUSWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUSAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?The head is not more native to the heart,The hand more instrumental to the mouth,Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes?LAERTESMy dread lord,Your leave and favour to return to France;From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,To show my duty in your coronation,Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,My thoughts and wishes bend again toward FranceAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.KING CLAUDIUSHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?LORD POLONIUSHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leaveBy laboursome petition, and at lastUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent:I do beseech you, give him leave to go.KING CLAUDIUSTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,And thy best graces spend it at thy will!But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--HAMLET[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.KING CLAUDIUSHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?HAMLETNot so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.QUEEN GERTRUDEGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.Do not for ever with thy vailed lidsSeek for thy noble father in the dust:Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,Passing through nature to eternity.HAMLETAy, madam, it is common.QUEEN GERTRUDEIf it be,Why seems it so particular with thee?HAMLETSeems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.''Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,Nor customary suits of solemn black,Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,For they are actions that a man might play:But I have that within which passeth show;These but the trappings and the suits of woe.KING CLAUDIUS'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,To give these mourning duties to your father:But, you must know, your father lost a father;That father lost, lost his, and the survivor boundIn filial obligation for some termTo do obsequious sorrow: but to perseverIn obstinate condolement is a courseOf impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,An understanding simple and unschool'd:For what we know must be and is as commonAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,Why should we in our peevish oppositionTake it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,To reason most absurd: whose common themeIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,From the first corse till he that died to-day,'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earthThis unprevailing woe, and think of usAs of a father: for let the world take note,You are the most immediate to our throne;And with no less nobility of loveThan that which dearest father bears his son,Do I impart toward you. For your intentIn going back to school in Wittenberg,It is most retrograde to our desire:And we beseech you, bend you to remainHere, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.QUEEN GERTRUDELet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.HAMLETI shall in all my best obey you, madam.KING CLAUDIUSWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;This gentle and unforced accord of HamletSits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.Exeunt all but HAMLETHAMLETO, that this too too solid flesh would meltThaw and resolve itself into a dew!Or that the Everlasting had not fix'dHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,Seem to me all the uses of this world!Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,That grows to seed; things rank and gross in naturePossess it merely. That it should come to this!But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:So excellent a king; that was, to this,Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my motherThat he might not beteem the winds of heavenVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,As if increase of appetite had grownBy what it fed on: and yet, within a month--Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--A little month, or ere those shoes were oldWith which she follow'd my poor father's body,Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,My father's brother, but no more like my fatherThan I to Hercules: within a month:Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearsHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,She married. O, most wicked speed, to postWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!It is not nor it cannot come to good:But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDOHORATIOHail to your lordship!HAMLETI am glad to see you well:Horatio,--or I do forget myself.HORATIOThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.HAMLETSir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?MARCELLUSMy good lord--HAMLETI am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?HORATIOA truant disposition, good my lord.HAMLETI would not hear your enemy say so,Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,To make it truster of your own reportAgainst yourself: I know you are no truant.But what is your affair in Elsinore?We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.HORATIOMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.HAMLETI pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;I think it was to see my mother's wedding.HORATIOIndeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.HAMLETThrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meatsDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.Would I had met my dearest foe in heavenOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!My father!--methinks I see my father.HORATIOWhere, my lord?HAMLETIn my mind's eye, Horatio.HORATIOI saw him once; he was a goodly king.HAMLETHe was a man, take him for all in all,I shall not look upon his like again.HORATIOMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.HAMLETSaw? who?HORATIOMy lord, the king your father.HAMLETThe king my father!HORATIOSeason your admiration for awhileWith an attent ear, till I may deliver,Upon the witness of these gentlemen,This marvel to you.HAMLETFor God's love, let me hear.HORATIOTwo nights together had these gentlemen,Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,In the dead vast and middle of the night,Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,Appears before them, and with solemn marchGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'dBy their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilledAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to meIn dreadful secrecy impart they did;And I with them the third night kept the watch;Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,Form of the thing, each word made true and good,The apparition comes: I knew your father;These hands are not more like.HAMLETBut where was this?MARCELLUSMy lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.HAMLETDid you not speak to it?HORATIOMy lord, I did;But answer made it none: yet once methoughtIt lifted up its head and did addressItself to motion, like as it would speak;But even then the morning cock crew loud,And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,And vanish'd from our sight.HAMLET'Tis very strange.HORATIOAs I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;And we did think it writ down in our dutyTo let you know of it.HAMLETIndeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.Hold you the watch to-night?MARCELLUS BERNARDOWe do, my lord.HAMLETArm'd, say you?MARCELLUS BERNARDOArm'd, my lord.HAMLETFrom top to toe?MARCELLUS BERNARDOMy lord, from head to foot.HAMLETThen saw you not his face?HORATIOO, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.HAMLETWhat, look'd he frowningly?HORATIOA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.HAMLETPale or red?HORATIONay, very pale.HAMLETAnd fix'd his eyes upon you?HORATIOMost constantly.HAMLETI would I had been there.HORATIOIt would have much amazed you.HAMLETVery like, very like. Stay'd it long?HORATIOWhile one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.MARCELLUS BERNARDOLonger, longer.HORATIONot when I saw't.HAMLETHis beard was grizzled--no?HORATIOIt was, as I have seen it in his life,A sable silver'd.HAMLETI will watch to-night;Perchance 'twill walk again.HORATIOI warrant it will.HAMLETIf it assume my noble father's person,I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gapeAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,Let it be tenable in your silence still;And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,Give it an understanding, but no tongue:I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,I'll visit you.AllOur duty to your honour.HAMLETYour loves, as mine to you: farewell.Exeunt all but HAMLETMy father's spirit in arms! all is not well;I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.ExitSCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.Enter LAERTES and OPHELIALAERTESMy necessaries are embark'd: farewell:And, sister, as the winds give benefitAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,But let me hear from you.OPHELIADo you doubt that?LAERTESFor Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,A violet in the youth of primy nature,Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.OPHELIANo more but so?LAERTESThink it no more;For nature, crescent, does not grow aloneIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,The inward service of the mind and soulGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchThe virtue of his will: but you must fear,His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;For he himself is subject to his birth:He may not, as unvalued persons do,Carve for himself; for on his choice dependsThe safety and health of this whole state;And therefore must his choice be circumscribedUnto the voice and yielding of that bodyWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,It fits your wisdom so far to believe itAs he in his particular act and placeMay give his saying deed; which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,If with too credent ear you list his songs,Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure openTo his unmaster'd importunity.Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,And keep you in the rear of your affection,Out of the shot and danger of desire.The chariest maid is prodigal enough,If she unmask her beauty to the moon:Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:The canker galls the infants of the spring,Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,And in the morn and liquid dew of youthContagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.OPHELIAI shall the effect of this good lesson keep,As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,And recks not his own rede.LAERTESO, fear me not.I stay too long: but here my father comes.Enter POLONIUSA double blessing is a double grace,Occasion smiles upon a second leave.LORD POLONIUSYet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!And these few precepts in thy memorySee thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel, but being in,Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;For the apparel oft proclaims the man,And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be;For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine ownself be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!LAERTESMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.LORD POLONIUSThe time invites you; go; your servants tend.LAERTESFarewell, Ophelia; and remember wellWhat I have said to you.OPHELIA'Tis in my memory lock'd,And you yourself shall keep the key of it.LAERTESFarewell.ExitLORD POLONIUSWhat is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?OPHELIASo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.LORD POLONIUSMarry, well bethought:'Tis told me, he hath very oft of lateGiven private time to you; and you yourselfHave of your audience been most free and bounteous:If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,And that in way of caution, I must tell you,You do not understand yourself so clearlyAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.What is between you? give me up the truth.OPHELIAHe hath, my lord, of late made many tendersOf his affection to me.LORD POLONIUSAffection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?OPHELIAI do not know, my lord, what I should think.LORD POLONIUSMarry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.OPHELIAMy lord, he hath importuned me with loveIn honourable fashion.LORD POLONIUSAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.OPHELIAAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,With almost all the holy vows of heaven.LORD POLONIUSAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,When the blood burns, how prodigal the soulLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,Even in their promise, as it is a-making,You must not take for fire. From this timeBe somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;Set your entreatments at a higher rateThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,Believe so much in him, that he is youngAnd with a larger tether may he walkThan may be given you: in few, Ophelia,Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,Not of that dye which their investments show,But mere implorators of unholy suits,Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,The better to beguile. This is for all:I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,Have you so slander any moment leisure,As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.OPHELIAI shall obey, my lord.ExeuntSCENE IV. The platform.Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUSHAMLETThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.HORATIOIt is a nipping and an eager air.HAMLETWhat hour now?HORATIOI think it lacks of twelve.HAMLETNo, it is struck.HORATIOIndeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the seasonWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, withinWhat does this mean, my lord?HAMLETThe king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his pledge.HORATIOIs it a custom?HAMLETAy, marry, is't:But to my mind, though I am native hereAnd to the manner born, it is a customMore honour'd in the breach than the observance.This heavy-headed revel east and westMakes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phraseSoil our addition; and indeed it takesFrom our achievements, though perform'd at height,The pith and marrow of our attribute.So, oft it chances in particular men,That for some vicious mole of nature in them,As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,Since nature cannot choose his origin--By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavensThe form of plausive manners, that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,As infinite as man may undergo--Shall in the general censure take corruptionFrom that particular fault: the dram of ealeDoth all the noble substance of a doubtTo his own scandal.HORATIOLook, my lord, it comes!Enter GhostHAMLETAngels and ministers of grace defend us!Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,Be thy intents wicked or charitable,Thou comest in such a questionable shapeThat I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!Let me not burst in ignorance; but tellWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,To cast thee up again. What may this mean,That thou, dead corse, again in complete steelRevisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,Making night hideous; and we fools of natureSo horridly to shake our dispositionWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?Ghost beckons HAMLETHORATIOIt beckons you to go away with it,As if it some impartment did desireTo you alone.MARCELLUSLook, with what courteous actionIt waves you to a more removed ground:But do not go with it.HORATIONo, by no means.HAMLETIt will not speak; then I will follow it.HORATIODo not, my lord.HAMLETWhy, what should be the fear?I do not set my life in a pin's fee;And for my soul, what can it do to that,Being a thing immortal as itself?It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.HORATIOWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,Or to the dreadful summit of the cliffThat beetles o'er his base into the sea,And there assume some other horrible form,Which might deprive your sovereignty of reasonAnd draw you into madness? think of it:The very place puts toys of desperation,Without more motive, into every brainThat looks so many fathoms to the seaAnd hears it roar beneath.HAMLETIt waves me still.Go on; I'll follow thee.MARCELLUSYou shall not go, my lord.HAMLETHold off your hands.HORATIOBe ruled; you shall not go.HAMLETMy fate cries out,And makes each petty artery in this bodyAs hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.Exeunt Ghost and HAMLETHORATIOHe waxes desperate with imagination.MARCELLUSLet's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.HORATIOHave after. To what issue will this come?MARCELLUSSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.HORATIOHeaven will direct it.MARCELLUSNay, let's follow him.ExeuntSCENE V. Another part of the platform.Enter GHOST and HAMLETHAMLETWhere wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.GhostMark me.HAMLETI will.GhostMy hour is almost come,When I to sulphurous and tormenting flamesMust render up myself.HAMLETAlas, poor ghost!GhostPity me not, but lend thy serious hearingTo what I shall unfold.HAMLETSpeak; I am bound to hear.GhostSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.HAMLETWhat?GhostI am thy father's spirit,Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,And for the day confined to fast in fires,Till the foul crimes done in my days of natureAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbidTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,I could a tale unfold whose lightest wordWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,Thy knotted and combined locks to partAnd each particular hair to stand on end,Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:But this eternal blazon must not beTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!If thou didst ever thy dear father love--HAMLETO God!GhostRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.HAMLETMurder!GhostMurder most foul, as in the best it is;But this most foul, strange and unnatural.HAMLETHaste me to know't, that I, with wings as swiftAs meditation or the thoughts of love,May sweep to my revenge.GhostI find thee apt;And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of DenmarkIs by a forged process of my deathRankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting thy father's lifeNow wears his crown.HAMLETO my prophetic soul! My uncle!GhostAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--O wicked wit and gifts, that have the powerSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lustThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!From me, whose love was of that dignityThat it went hand in hand even with the vowI made to her in marriage, and to declineUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poorTo those of mine!But virtue, as it never will be moved,Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,Will sate itself in a celestial bed,And prey on garbage.But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,My custom always of the afternoon,Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,And in the porches of my ears did pourThe leperous distilment; whose effectHolds such an enmity with blood of manThat swift as quicksilver it courses throughThe natural gates and alleys of the body,And with a sudden vigour doth possetAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;And a most instant tetter bark'd about,Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,All my smooth body.Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's handOf life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,No reckoning made, but sent to my accountWith all my imperfections on my head:O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;Let not the royal bed of Denmark beA couch for luxury and damned incest.But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contriveAgainst thy mother aught: leave her to heavenAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.ExitHAMLETO all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seatIn this distracted globe. Remember thee!Yea, from the table of my memoryI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,That youth and observation copied there;And thy commandment all alone shall liveWithin the book and volume of my brain,Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!O most pernicious woman!O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!My tables,--meet it is I set it down,That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:WritingSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'I have sworn 't.MARCELLUS HORATIO[Within] My lord, my lord,--MARCELLUS[Within] Lord Hamlet,--HORATIO[Within] Heaven secure him!HAMLETSo be it!HORATIO[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!HAMLETHillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUSMARCELLUSHow is't, my noble lord?HORATIOWhat news, my lord?HAMLETO, wonderful!HORATIOGood my lord, tell it.HAMLETNo; you'll reveal it.HORATIONot I, my lord, by heaven.MARCELLUSNor I, my lord.HAMLETHow say you, then; would heart of man once think it?But you'll be secret?HORATIO MARCELLUSAy, by heaven, my lord.HAMLETThere's ne'er a villain dwelling in all DenmarkBut he's an arrant knave.HORATIOThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the graveTo tell us this.HAMLETWhy, right; you are i' the right;And so, without more circumstance at all,I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:You, as your business and desire shall point you;For every man has business and desire,Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,Look you, I'll go pray.HORATIOThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.HAMLETI'm sorry they offend you, heartily;Yes, 'faith heartily.HORATIOThere's no offence, my lord.HAMLETYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,And much offence too. Touching this vision here,It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:For your desire to know what is between us,O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,Give me one poor request.HORATIOWhat is't, my lord? we will.HAMLETNever make known what you have seen to-night.HORATIO MARCELLUSMy lord, we will not.HAMLETNay, but swear't.HORATIOIn faith,My lord, not I.MARCELLUSNor I, my lord, in faith.HAMLETUpon my sword.MARCELLUSWe have sworn, my lord, already.HAMLETIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETAh, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,truepenny?Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--Consent to swear.HORATIOPropose the oath, my lord.HAMLETNever to speak of this that you have seen,Swear by my sword.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETHic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.Come hither, gentlemen,And lay your hands again upon my sword:Never to speak of this that you have heard,Swear by my sword.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETWell said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.HORATIOO day and night, but this is wondrous strange!HAMLETAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,As I perchance hereafter shall think meetTo put an antic disposition on,That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'Or such ambiguous giving out, to noteThat you know aught of me: this not to do,So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.Ghost[Beneath] Swear.HAMLETRest, rest, perturbed spirit!They swearSo, gentlemen,With all my love I do commend me to you:And what so poor a man as Hamlet isMay do, to express his love and friending to you,God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,That ever I was born to set it right!Nay, come, let's go together.ExeuntACT IISCENE I.

Look you, sir,Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,What company, at what expense; and findingBy this encompassment and drift of questionThat they do know my son, come you more nearerThan your particular demands will touch it:Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?REYNALDOAy, very well, my lord.LORD POLONIUS'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;Addicted so and so:' and there put on himWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rankAs may dishonour him; take heed of that;But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slipsAs are companions noted and most knownTo youth and liberty.REYNALDOAs gaming, my lord.LORD POLONIUSAy, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,Drabbing: you may go so far.REYNALDOMy lord, that would dishonour him.LORD POLONIUS'Faith, no; as you may season it in the chargeYou must not put another scandal on him,That he is open to incontinency;That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintlyThat they may seem the taints of liberty,The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,A savageness in unreclaimed blood,Of general assault.REYNALDOBut, my good lord,--LORD POLONIUSWherefore should you do this?REYNALDOAy, my lord,I would know that.LORD POLONIUSMarry, sir, here's my drift;And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:You laying these slight sullies on my son,As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,Your party in converse, him you would sound,Having ever seen in the prenominate crimesThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assuredHe closes with you in this consequence;'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'According to the phrase or the additionOf man and country.REYNALDOVery good, my lord.LORD POLONIUSAnd then, sir, does he this--he does--what was Iabout to say? By the mass, I was about to saysomething: where did I leave?REYNALDOAt 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'and 'gentleman.'LORD POLONIUSAt 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.See you now;Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,With windlasses and with assays of bias,By indirections find directions out:So by my former lecture and advice,Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?REYNALDOMy lord, I have.LORD POLONIUSGod be wi' you; fare you well.REYNALDOGood my lord!LORD POLONIUSObserve his inclination in yourself.REYNALDOI shall, my lord.LORD POLONIUSAnd let him ply his music.REYNALDOWell, my lord.LORD POLONIUSFarewell!Exit REYNALDOEnter OPHELIAHow now, Ophelia! what's the matter?OPHELIAO, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!LORD POLONIUSWith what, i' the name of God?OPHELIAMy lord, as I was sewing in my closet,Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;And with a look so piteous in purportAs if he had been loosed out of hellTo speak of horrors,--he comes before me.LORD POLONIUSMad for thy love?OPHELIAMy lord, I do not know;But truly, I do fear it.LORD POLONIUSWhat said he?OPHELIAHe took me by the wrist and held me hard;Then goes he to the length of all his arm;And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,He falls to such perusal of my faceAs he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;At last, a little shaking of mine armAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,He raised a sigh so piteous and profoundAs it did seem to shatter all his bulkAnd end his being: that done, he lets me go:And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;For out o' doors he went without their helps,And, to the last, bended their light on me.LORD POLONIUSCome, go with me: I will go seek the king.This is the very ecstasy of love,Whose violent property fordoes itselfAnd leads the will to desperate undertakingsAs oft as any passion under heavenThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.What, have you given him any hard words of late?OPHELIANo, my good lord, but, as you did command,I did repel his fetters and deniedHis access to me.LORD POLONIUSThat hath made him mad.I am sorry that with better heed and judgmentI had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!By heaven, it is as proper to our ageTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinionsAs it is common for the younger sortTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:This must be known; which, being kept close, mightmoveMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.ExeuntSCENE II. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and AttendantsKING CLAUDIUSWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!Moreover that we much did long to see you,The need we have to use you did provokeOur hasty sending. Something have you heardOf Hamlet's transformation; so call it,Sith nor the exterior nor the inward manResembles that it was. What it should be,More than his father's death, that thus hath put himSo much from the understanding of himself,I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,That, being of so young days brought up with him,And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtSome little time: so by your companiesTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,So much as from occasion you may glean,Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,That, open'd, lies within our remedy.QUEEN GERTRUDEGood gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;And sure I am two men there are not livingTo whom he more adheres. If it will please youTo show us so much gentry and good willAs to expend your time with us awhile,For the supply and profit of our hope,Your visitation shall receive such thanksAs fits a king's remembrance.ROSENCRANTZBoth your majestiesMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,Put your dread pleasures more into commandThan to entreaty.GUILDENSTERNBut we both obey,And here give up ourselves, in the full bentTo lay our service freely at your feet,To be commanded.KING CLAUDIUSThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.QUEEN GERTRUDEThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:And I beseech you instantly to visitMy too much changed son. Go, some of you,And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.GUILDENSTERNHeavens make our presence and our practisesPleasant and helpful to him!QUEEN GERTRUDEAy, amen!Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some AttendantsEnter POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSThe ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,Are joyfully return'd.KING CLAUDIUSThou still hast been the father of good news.LORD POLONIUSHave I, my lord? I assure my good liege,I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,Both to my God and to my gracious king:And I do think, or else this brain of mineHunts not the trail of policy so sureAs it hath used to do, that I have foundThe very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.KING CLAUDIUSO, speak of that; that do I long to hear.LORD POLONIUSGive first admittance to the ambassadors;My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.KING CLAUDIUSThyself do grace to them, and bring them in.Exit POLONIUSHe tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath foundThe head and source of all your son's distemper.QUEEN GERTRUDEI doubt it is no other but the main;His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.KING CLAUDIUSWell, we shall sift him.Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUSWelcome, my good friends!Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?VOLTIMANDMost fair return of greetings and desires.Upon our first, he sent out to suppressHis nephew's levies; which to him appear'dTo be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;But, better look'd into, he truly foundIt was against your highness: whereat grieved,That so his sickness, age and impotenceWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrestsOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fineMakes vow before his uncle never moreTo give the assay of arms against your majesty.Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,And his commission to employ those soldiers,So levied as before, against the Polack:With an entreaty, herein further shown,Giving a paperThat it might please you to give quiet passThrough your dominions for this enterprise,On such regards of safety and allowanceAs therein are set down.KING CLAUDIUSIt likes us well;And at our more consider'd time well read,Answer, and think upon this business.Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:Most welcome home!Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUSLORD POLONIUSThis business is well ended.My liege, and madam, to expostulateWhat majesty should be, what duty is,Why day is day, night night, and time is time,Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,I will be brief: your noble son is mad:Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,What is't but to be nothing else but mad?But let that go.QUEEN GERTRUDEMore matter, with less art.LORD POLONIUSMadam, I swear I use no art at all.That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;But farewell it, for I will use no art.Mad let us grant him, then: and now remainsThat we find out the cause of this effect,Or rather say, the cause of this defect,For this effect defective comes by cause:Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.I have a daughter--have while she is mine--Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.Reads'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the mostbeautified Ophelia,'--That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' isa vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:Reads'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'QUEEN GERTRUDECame this from Hamlet to her?LORD POLONIUSGood madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.Reads'Doubt thou the stars are fire;Doubt that the sun doth move;Doubt truth to be a liar;But never doubt I love.'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;I have not art to reckon my groans: but thatI love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilstthis machine is to him, HAMLET.'This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,And more above, hath his solicitings,As they fell out by time, by means and place,All given to mine ear.KING CLAUDIUSBut how hath sheReceived his love?LORD POLONIUSWhat do you think of me?KING CLAUDIUSAs of a man faithful and honourable.LORD POLONIUSI would fain prove so. But what might you think,When I had seen this hot love on the wing--As I perceived it, I must tell you that,Before my daughter told me--what might you,Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,If I had play'd the desk or table-book,Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;What might you think? No, I went round to work,And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,That she should lock herself from his resort,Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,Into the madness wherein now he raves,And all we mourn for.KING CLAUDIUSDo you think 'tis this?QUEEN GERTRUDEIt may be, very likely.LORD POLONIUSHath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--That I have positively said 'Tis so,'When it proved otherwise?KING CLAUDIUSNot that I know.LORD POLONIUS[Pointing to his head and shoulder]Take this from this, if this be otherwise:If circumstances lead me, I will findWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeedWithin the centre.KING CLAUDIUSHow may we try it further?LORD POLONIUSYou know, sometimes he walks four hours togetherHere in the lobby.QUEEN GERTRUDESo he does indeed.LORD POLONIUSAt such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:Be you and I behind an arras then;Mark the encounter: if he love her notAnd be not from his reason fall'n thereon,Let me be no assistant for a state,But keep a farm and carters.KING CLAUDIUSWe will try it.QUEEN GERTRUDEBut, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.LORD POLONIUSAway, I do beseech you, both away:I'll board him presently.Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and AttendantsEnter HAMLET, readingO, give me leave:How does my good Lord Hamlet?HAMLETWell, God-a-mercy.LORD POLONIUSDo you know me, my lord?HAMLETExcellent well; you are a fishmonger.LORD POLONIUSNot I, my lord.HAMLETThen I would you were so honest a man.LORD POLONIUSHonest, my lord!HAMLETAy, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to beone man picked out of ten thousand.LORD POLONIUSThat's very true, my lord.HAMLETFor if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being agod kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?LORD POLONIUSI have, my lord.HAMLETLet her not walk i' the sun: conception is ablessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.Friend, look to 't.LORD POLONIUS[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on mydaughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said Iwas a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: andtruly in my youth I suffered much extremity forlove; very near this. I'll speak to him again.What do you read, my lord?HAMLETWords, words, words.LORD POLONIUSWhat is the matter, my lord?HAMLETBetween who?LORD POLONIUSI mean, the matter that you read, my lord.HAMLETSlanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says herethat old men have grey beards, that their faces arewrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber andplum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack ofwit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,though I most powerfully and potently believe, yetI hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, foryourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crabyou could go backward.LORD POLONIUS[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is methodin 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?HAMLETInto my grave.LORD POLONIUSIndeed, that is out o' the air.AsideHow pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happinessthat often madness hits on, which reason and sanitycould not so prosperously be delivered of. I willleave him, and suddenly contrive the means ofmeeting between him and my daughter.--My honourablelord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.HAMLETYou cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I willmore willingly part withal: except my life, exceptmy life, except my life.LORD POLONIUSFare you well, my lord.HAMLETThese tedious old fools!Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNLORD POLONIUSYou go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.ROSENCRANTZ[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!Exit POLONIUSGUILDENSTERNMy honoured lord!ROSENCRANTZMy most dear lord!HAMLETMy excellent good friends! How dost thou,Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?ROSENCRANTZAs the indifferent children of the earth.GUILDENSTERNHappy, in that we are not over-happy;On fortune's cap we are not the very button.HAMLETNor the soles of her shoe?ROSENCRANTZNeither, my lord.HAMLETThen you live about her waist, or in the middle ofher favours?GUILDENSTERN'Faith, her privates we.HAMLETIn the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; sheis a strumpet. What's the news?ROSENCRANTZNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.HAMLETThen is doomsday near: but your news is not true.Let me question more in particular: what have you,my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,that she sends you to prison hither?GUILDENSTERNPrison, my lord!HAMLETDenmark's a prison.ROSENCRANTZThen is the world one.HAMLETA goodly one; in which there are many confines,wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.ROSENCRANTZWe think not so, my lord.HAMLETWhy, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothingeither good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to meit is a prison.ROSENCRANTZWhy then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis toonarrow for your mind.HAMLETO God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and countmyself a king of infinite space, were it not that Ihave bad dreams.GUILDENSTERNWhich dreams indeed are ambition, for the verysubstance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.HAMLETA dream itself is but a shadow.ROSENCRANTZTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light aquality that it is but a shadow's shadow.HAMLETThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs andoutstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall weto the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERNWe'll wait upon you.HAMLETNo such matter: I will not sort you with the restof my servants, for, to speak to you like an honestman, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in thebeaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?ROSENCRANTZTo visit you, my lord; no other occasion.HAMLETBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but Ithank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks aretoo dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is ityour own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.GUILDENSTERNWhat should we say, my lord?HAMLETWhy, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sentfor; and there is a kind of confession in your lookswhich your modesties have not craft enough to colour:I know the good king and queen have sent for you.ROSENCRANTZTo what end, my lord?HAMLETThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, bythe rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy ofour youth, by the obligation of our ever-preservedlove, and by what more dear a better proposer couldcharge you withal, be even and direct with me,whether you were sent for, or no?ROSENCRANTZ[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?HAMLET[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If youlove me, hold not off.GUILDENSTERNMy lord, we were sent for.HAMLETI will tell you why; so shall my anticipationprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the kingand queen moult no feather. I have of late--butwherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone allcustom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavilywith my disposition that this goodly frame, theearth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this mostexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this braveo'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof frettedwith golden fire, why, it appears no other thing tome than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!how infinite in faculty! in form and moving howexpress and admirable! in action how like an angel!in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of theworld! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,what is this quintessence of dust? man delights notme: no, nor woman neither, though by your smilingyou seem to say so.ROSENCRANTZMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.HAMLETWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?ROSENCRANTZTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, whatlenten entertainment the players shall receive fromyou: we coted them on the way; and hither are theycoming, to offer you service.HAMLETHe that plays the king shall be welcome; his majestyshall have tribute of me; the adventurous knightshall use his foil and target; the lover shall notsigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his partin peace; the clown shall make those laugh whoselungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shallsay her mind freely, or the blank verse shall haltfor't. What players are they?ROSENCRANTZEven those you were wont to take delight in, thetragedians of the city.HAMLETHow chances it they travel? their residence, bothin reputation and profit, was better both ways.ROSENCRANTZI think their inhibition comes by the means of thelate innovation.HAMLETDo they hold the same estimation they did when I wasin the city? are they so followed?ROSENCRANTZNo, indeed, are they not.HAMLETHow comes it? do they grow rusty?ROSENCRANTZNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: butthere is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,that cry out on the top of question, and are mosttyrannically clapped for't: these are now thefashion, and so berattle the common stages--so theycall them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid ofgoose-quills and dare scarce come thither.HAMLETWhat, are they children? who maintains 'em? how arethey escoted? Will they pursue the quality nolonger than they can sing? will they not sayafterwards, if they should grow themselves to commonplayers--as it is most like, if their means are nobetter--their writers do them wrong, to make themexclaim against their own succession?ROSENCRANTZ'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; andthe nation holds it no sin to tarre them tocontroversy: there was, for a while, no money bidfor argument, unless the poet and the player went tocuffs in the question.HAMLETIs't possible?GUILDENSTERNO, there has been much throwing about of brains.HAMLETDo the boys carry it away?ROSENCRANTZAy, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.HAMLETIt is not very strange; for mine uncle is king ofDenmark, and those that would make mows at him whilemy father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, anhundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.'Sblood, there is something in this more thannatural, if philosophy could find it out.Flourish of trumpets withinGUILDENSTERNThere are the players.HAMLETGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashionand ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,must show fairly outward, should more appear likeentertainment than yours. You are welcome: but myuncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.GUILDENSTERNIn what, my dear lord?HAMLETI am but mad north-north-west: when the wind issoutherly I know a hawk from a handsaw.Enter POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSWell be with you, gentlemen!HAMLETHark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear ahearer: that great baby you see there is not yetout of his swaddling-clouts.ROSENCRANTZHappily he's the second time come to them; for theysay an old man is twice a child.HAMLETI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;'twas so indeed.LORD POLONIUSMy lord, I have news to tell you.HAMLETMy lord, I have news to tell you.When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--LORD POLONIUSThe actors are come hither, my lord.HAMLETBuz, buz!LORD POLONIUSUpon mine honour,--HAMLETThen came each actor on his ass,--LORD POLONIUSThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy,comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, orpoem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, norPlautus too light. For the law of writ and theliberty, these are the only men.HAMLETO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!LORD POLONIUSWhat a treasure had he, my lord?HAMLETWhy,'One fair daughter and no more,The which he loved passing well.'LORD POLONIUS[Aside] Still on my daughter.HAMLETAm I not i' the right, old Jephthah?LORD POLONIUSIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughterthat I love passing well.HAMLETNay, that follows not.LORD POLONIUSWhat follows, then, my lord?HAMLETWhy,'As by lot, God wot,'and then, you know,'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--the first row of the pious chanson will show youmore; for look, where my abridgement comes.Enter four or five PlayersYou are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am gladto see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my oldfriend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my younglady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship isnearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by thealtitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, likeapiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within thering. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'ento't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a tasteof your quality; come, a passionate speech.First PlayerWhat speech, my lord?HAMLETI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it wasnever acted; or, if it was, not above once; for theplay, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twascaviare to the general: but it was--as I receivedit, and others, whose judgments in such matterscried in the top of mine--an excellent play, welldigested in the scenes, set down with as muchmodesty as cunning. I remember, one said therewere no sallets in the lines to make the mattersavoury, nor no matter in the phrase that mightindict the author of affectation; but called it anhonest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by verymuch more handsome than fine. One speech in it Ichiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; andthereabout of it especially, where he speaks ofPriam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, beginat this line: let me see, let me see--'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,Black as his purpose, did the night resembleWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'dWith heraldry more dismal; head to footNow is he total gules; horridly trick'dWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,Baked and impasted with the parching streets,That lend a tyrannous and damned lightTo their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish PyrrhusOld grandsire Priam seeks.'So, proceed you.LORD POLONIUS'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent andgood discretion.First Player'Anon he finds himStriking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;But with the whiff and wind of his fell swordThe unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming topStoops to his base, and with a hideous crashTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,Which was declining on the milky headOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,And like a neutral to his will and matter,Did nothing.But, as we often see, against some storm,A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,The bold winds speechless and the orb belowAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunderDoth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;And never did the Cyclops' hammers fallOn Mars's armour forged for proof eterneWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding swordNow falls on Priam.Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,In general synod 'take away her power;Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,As low as to the fiends!'LORD POLONIUSThis is too long.HAMLETIt shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or hesleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.First Player'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'HAMLET'The mobled queen?'LORD POLONIUSThat's good; 'mobled queen' is good.First Player'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flamesWith bisson rheum; a clout upon that headWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,'Gainst Fortune's state would treason havepronounced:But if the gods themselves did see her thenWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sportIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,The instant burst of clamour that she made,Unless things mortal move them not at all,Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,And passion in the gods.'LORD POLONIUSLook, whether he has not turned his colour and hastears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.HAMLET'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.Good my lord, will you see the players wellbestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; forthey are the abstract and brief chronicles of thetime: after your death you were better have a badepitaph than their ill report while you live.LORD POLONIUSMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.HAMLETGod's bodykins, man, much better: use every manafter his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?Use them after your own honour and dignity: the lessthey deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.Take them in.LORD POLONIUSCome, sirs.HAMLETFollow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the FirstDost thou hear me, old friend; can you play theMurder of Gonzago?First PlayerAy, my lord.HAMLETWe'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, whichI would set down and insert in't, could you not?First PlayerAy, my lord.HAMLETVery well. Follow that lord; and look you mock himnot.Exit First PlayerMy good friends, I'll leave you till night: you arewelcome to Elsinore.ROSENCRANTZGood my lord!HAMLETAy, so, God be wi' ye;Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNNow I am alone.O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!Is it not monstrous that this player here,But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,Could force his soul so to his own conceitThat from her working all his visage wann'd,Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,A broken voice, and his whole function suitingWith forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!For Hecuba!What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,That he should weep for her? What would he do,Had he the motive and the cue for passionThat I have? He would drown the stage with tearsAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,Make mad the guilty and appal the free,Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeedThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,And can say nothing; no, not for a king,Upon whose property and most dear lifeA damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?Ha!'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot beBut I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gallTo make oppression bitter, or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kitesWith this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!O, vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,A scullion!Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a playHave by the very cunning of the sceneBeen struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaim'd their malefactions;For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seenMay be the devil: and the devil hath powerTo assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me: I'll have groundsMore relative than this: the play 's the thingWherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.ExitACT IIISCENE I. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSAnd can you, by no drift of circumstance,Get from him why he puts on this confusion,Grating so harshly all his days of quietWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?ROSENCRANTZHe does confess he feels himself distracted;But from what cause he will by no means speak.GUILDENSTERNNor do we find him forward to be sounded,But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,When we would bring him on to some confessionOf his true state.QUEEN GERTRUDEDid he receive you well?ROSENCRANTZMost like a gentleman.GUILDENSTERNBut with much forcing of his disposition.ROSENCRANTZNiggard of question; but, of our demands,Most free in his reply.QUEEN GERTRUDEDid you assay him?To any pastime?ROSENCRANTZMadam, it so fell out, that certain playersWe o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;And there did seem in him a kind of joyTo hear of it: they are about the court,And, as I think, they have already orderThis night to play before him.LORD POLONIUS'Tis most true:And he beseech'd me to entreat your majestiesTo hear and see the matter.KING CLAUDIUSWith all my heart; and it doth much content meTo hear him so inclined.Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,And drive his purpose on to these delights.ROSENCRANTZWe shall, my lord.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSSweet Gertrude, leave us too;For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,That he, as 'twere by accident, may hereAffront Ophelia:Her father and myself, lawful espials,Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,We may of their encounter frankly judge,And gather by him, as he is behaved,If 't be the affliction of his love or noThat thus he suffers for.QUEEN GERTRUDEI shall obey you.And for your part, Ophelia, I do wishThat your good beauties be the happy causeOf Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtuesWill bring him to his wonted way again,To both your honours.OPHELIAMadam, I wish it may.Exit QUEEN GERTRUDELORD POLONIUSOphelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,We will bestow ourselves.To OPHELIARead on this book;That show of such an exercise may colourYour loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visageAnd pious action we do sugar o'erThe devil himself.KING CLAUDIUS[Aside] O, 'tis too true!How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps itThan is my deed to my most painted word:O heavy burthen!LORD POLONIUSI hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUSEnter HAMLETHAMLETTo be, or not to be, that is the question,Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause: there's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life;For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,The insolence of office and the spurnsThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscover'd country from whose bournNo traveller returns, puzzles the willAnd makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;And thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,And enterprises of great pith and momentWith this regard their currents turn awry,And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisonsBe all my sins remember'd.OPHELIAGood my lord,How does your honour for this many a day?HAMLETI humbly thank you; well, well, well.OPHELIAMy lord, I have remembrances of yours,That I have longed long to re-deliver;I pray you, now receive them.HAMLETNo, not I;I never gave you aught.OPHELIAMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did;And, with them, words of so sweet breath composedAs made the things more rich: their perfume lost,Take these again; for to the noble mindRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.There, my lord.HAMLETHa, ha! are you honest?OPHELIAMy lord?HAMLETAre you fair?OPHELIAWhat means your lordship?HAMLETThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty shouldadmit no discourse to your beauty.OPHELIACould beauty, my lord, have better commerce thanwith honesty?HAMLETAy, truly; for the power of beauty will soonertransform honesty from what it is to a bawd than theforce of honesty can translate beauty into hislikeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now thetime gives it proof. I did love you once.OPHELIAIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.HAMLETYou should not have believed me; for virtue cannotso inoculate our old stock but we shall relish ofit: I loved you not.OPHELIAI was the more deceived.HAMLETGet thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be abreeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;but yet I could accuse me of such things that itwere better my mother had not borne me: I am veryproud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences atmy beck than I have thoughts to put them in,imagination to give them shape, or time to act themin. What should such fellows as I do crawlingbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.Where's your father?OPHELIAAt home, my lord.HAMLETLet the doors be shut upon him, that he may play thefool no where but in's own house. Farewell.OPHELIAO, help him, you sweet heavens!HAMLETIf thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague forthy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure assnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to anunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needsmarry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enoughwhat monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,and quickly too. Farewell.OPHELIAO heavenly powers, restore him!HAMLETI have heard of your paintings too, well enough; Godhas given you one face, and you make yourselvesanother: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, andnick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonnessyour ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hathmade me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:those that are married already, all but one, shalllive; the rest shall keep as they are. To anunnery, go.ExitOPHELIAO, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;The expectancy and rose of the fair state,The glass of fashion and the mould of form,The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,That suck'd the honey of his music vows,Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youthBlasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUSKING CLAUDIUSLove! his affections do not that way tend;Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;And I do doubt the hatch and the discloseWill be some danger: which for to prevent,I have in quick determinationThus set it down: he shall with speed to England,For the demand of our neglected tributeHaply the seas and countries differentWith variable objects shall expelThis something-settled matter in his heart,Whereon his brains still beating puts him thusFrom fashion of himself. What think you on't?LORD POLONIUSIt shall do well: but yet do I believeThe origin and commencement of his griefSprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;But, if you hold it fit, after the playLet his queen mother all alone entreat himTo show his grief: let her be round with him;And I'll be placed, so please you, in the earOf all their conference. If she find him not,To England send him, or confine him whereYour wisdom best shall think.KING CLAUDIUSIt shall be so:Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.ExeuntSCENE II. A hall in the castle.Enter HAMLET and PlayersHAMLETSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it toyou, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,as many of your players do, I had as lief thetown-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the airtoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and begeta temperance that may give it smoothness. O, itoffends me to the soul to hear a robustiousperiwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, tovery rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, whofor the most part are capable of nothing butinexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have sucha fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; itout-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.First PlayerI warrant your honour.HAMLETBe not too tame neither, but let your own discretionbe your tutor: suit the action to the word, theword to the action; with this special o'erstep notthe modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone isfrom the purpose of playing, whose end, both at thefirst and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, themirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,scorn her own image, and the very age and body ofthe time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,or come tardy off, though it make the unskilfullaugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; thecensure of the which one must in your allowanceo'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there beplayers that I have seen play, and heard otherspraise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,that, neither having the accent of Christians northe gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have sostrutted and bellowed that I have thought some ofnature's journeymen had made men and not made themwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.First PlayerI hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,sir.HAMLETO, reform it altogether. And let those that playyour clowns speak no more than is set down for them;for there be of them that will themselves laugh, toset on some quantity of barren spectators to laughtoo; though, in the mean time, some necessaryquestion of the play be then to be considered:that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambitionin the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.Exeunt PlayersEnter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNHow now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?LORD POLONIUSAnd the queen too, and that presently.HAMLETBid the players make haste.Exit POLONIUSWill you two help to hasten them?ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERNWe will, my lord.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNHAMLETWhat ho! Horatio!Enter HORATIOHORATIOHere, sweet lord, at your service.HAMLETHoratio, thou art e'en as just a manAs e'er my conversation coped withal.HORATIOO, my dear lord,--HAMLETNay, do not think I flatter;For what advancement may I hope from theeThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits,To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,And crook the pregnant hinges of the kneeWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul was mistress of her choiceAnd could of men distinguish, her electionHath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast beenAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,A man that fortune's buffets and rewardsHast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are thoseWhose blood and judgment are so well commingled,That they are not a pipe for fortune's fingerTo sound what stop she please. Give me that manThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear himIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--There is a play to-night before the king;One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee of my father's death:I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,Even with the very comment of thy soulObserve mine uncle: if his occulted guiltDo not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damned ghost that we have seen,And my imaginations are as foulAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,And after we will both our judgments joinIn censure of his seeming.HORATIOWell, my lord:If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.HAMLETThey are coming to the play; I must be idle:Get you a place.Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and othersKING CLAUDIUSHow fares our cousin Hamlet?HAMLETExcellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eatthe air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.KING CLAUDIUSI have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these wordsare not mine.HAMLETNo, nor mine now.To POLONIUSMy lord, you played once i' the university, you say?LORD POLONIUSThat did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.HAMLETWhat did you enact?LORD POLONIUSI did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' theCapitol; Brutus killed me.HAMLETIt was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calfthere. Be the players ready?ROSENCRANTZAy, my lord; they stay upon your patience.QUEEN GERTRUDECome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.HAMLETNo, good mother, here's metal more attractive.LORD POLONIUS[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?HAMLETLady, shall I lie in your lap?Lying down at OPHELIA's feetOPHELIANo, my lord.HAMLETI mean, my head upon your lap?OPHELIAAy, my lord.HAMLETDo you think I meant country matters?OPHELIAI think nothing, my lord.HAMLETThat's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.OPHELIAWhat is, my lord?HAMLETNothing.OPHELIAYou are merry, my lord.HAMLETWho, I?OPHELIAAy, my lord.HAMLETO God, your only jig-maker. What should a man dobut be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully mymother looks, and my father died within these two hours.OPHELIANay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.HAMLETSo long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, forI'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die twomonths ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there'shope a great man's memory may outlive his life halfa year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, withthe hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,the hobby-horse is forgot.'Hautboys play. The dumb-show entersEnter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his loveExeuntOPHELIAWhat means this, my lord?HAMLETMarry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.OPHELIABelike this show imports the argument of the play.Enter PrologueHAMLETWe shall know by this fellow: the players cannotkeep counsel; they'll tell all.OPHELIAWill he tell us what this show meant?HAMLETAy, or any show that you'll show him: be not youashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.OPHELIAYou are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.PrologueFor us, and for our tragedy,Here stooping to your clemency,We beg your hearing patiently.ExitHAMLETIs this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?OPHELIA'Tis brief, my lord.HAMLETAs woman's love.Enter two Players, King and QueenPlayer KingFull thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone roundNeptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheenAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,Since love our hearts and Hymen did our handsUnite commutual in most sacred bands.Player QueenSo many journeys may the sun and moonMake us again count o'er ere love be done!But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,So far from cheer and from your former state,That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:For women's fear and love holds quantity;In neither aught, or in extremity.Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;And as my love is sized, my fear is so:Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.Player King'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;My operant powers their functions leave to do:And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kindFor husband shalt thou--Player QueenO, confound the rest!Such love must needs be treason in my breast:In second husband let me be accurst!None wed the second but who kill'd the first.HAMLET[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.Player QueenThe instances that second marriage moveAre base respects of thrift, but none of love:A second time I kill my husband dead,When second husband kisses me in bed.Player KingI do believe you think what now you speak;But what we do determine oft we break.Purpose is but the slave to memory,Of violent birth, but poor validity;Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.Most necessary 'tis that we forgetTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:What to ourselves in passion we propose,The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.The violence of either grief or joyTheir own enactures with themselves destroy:Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strangeThat even our loves should with our fortunes change;For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;For who not needs shall never lack a friend,And who in want a hollow friend doth try,Directly seasons him his enemy.But, orderly to end where I begun,Our wills and fates do so contrary runThat our devices still are overthrown;Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:So think thou wilt no second husband wed;But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.Player QueenNor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!Sport and repose lock from me day and night!To desperation turn my trust and hope!An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!Each opposite that blanks the face of joyMeet what I would have well and it destroy!Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,If, once a widow, ever I be wife!HAMLETIf she should break it now!Player King'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguileThe tedious day with sleep.SleepsPlayer QueenSleep rock thy brain,And never come mischance between us twain!ExitHAMLETMadam, how like you this play?QUEEN GERTRUDEThe lady protests too much, methinks.HAMLETO, but she'll keep her word.KING CLAUDIUSHave you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?HAMLETNo, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offencei' the world.KING CLAUDIUSWhat do you call the play?HAMLETThe Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This playis the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago isthe duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall seeanon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'that? your majesty and we that have free souls, ittouches us not: let the galled jade wince, ourwithers are unwrung.Enter LUCIANUSThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.OPHELIAYou are as good as a chorus, my lord.HAMLETI could interpret between you and your love, if Icould see the puppets dallying.OPHELIAYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.HAMLETIt would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.OPHELIAStill better, and worse.HAMLETSo you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'LUCIANUSThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;Confederate season, else no creature seeing;Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,Thy natural magic and dire property,On wholesome life usurp immediately.Pours the poison into the sleeper's earsHAMLETHe poisons him i' the garden for's estate. Hisname's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ inchoice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderergets the love of Gonzago's wife.OPHELIAThe king rises.HAMLETWhat, frighted with false fire!QUEEN GERTRUDEHow fares my lord?LORD POLONIUSGive o'er the play.KING CLAUDIUSGive me some light: away!AllLights, lights, lights!Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIOHAMLETWhy, let the stricken deer go weep,The hart ungalled play;For some must watch, while some must sleep:So runs the world away.Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- ifthe rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with twoProvincial roses on my razed shoes, get me afellowship in a cry of players, sir?HORATIOHalf a share.HAMLETA whole one, I.For thou dost know, O Damon dear,This realm dismantled wasOf Jove himself; and now reigns hereA very, very--pajock.HORATIOYou might have rhymed.HAMLETO good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for athousand pound. Didst perceive?HORATIOVery well, my lord.HAMLETUpon the talk of the poisoning?HORATIOI did very well note him.HAMLETAh, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!For if the king like not the comedy,Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.Come, some music!Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNGUILDENSTERNGood my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.HAMLETSir, a whole history.GUILDENSTERNThe king, sir,--HAMLETAy, sir, what of him?GUILDENSTERNIs in his retirement marvellous distempered.HAMLETWith drink, sir?GUILDENSTERNNo, my lord, rather with choler.HAMLETYour wisdom should show itself more richer tosignify this to his doctor; for, for me to put himto his purgation would perhaps plunge him into farmore choler.GUILDENSTERNGood my lord, put your discourse into some frame andstart not so wildly from my affair.HAMLETI am tame, sir: pronounce.GUILDENSTERNThe queen, your mother, in most great affliction ofspirit, hath sent me to you.HAMLETYou are welcome.GUILDENSTERNNay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the rightbreed. If it shall please you to make me awholesome answer, I will do your mother'scommandment: if not, your pardon and my returnshall be the end of my business.HAMLETSir, I cannot.GUILDENSTERNWhat, my lord?HAMLETMake you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore nomore, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--ROSENCRANTZThen thus she says; your behavior hath struck herinto amazement and admiration.HAMLETO wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! Butis there no sequel at the heels of this mother'sadmiration? Impart.ROSENCRANTZShe desires to speak with you in her closet, ere yougo to bed.HAMLETWe shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Haveyou any further trade with us?ROSENCRANTZMy lord, you once did love me.HAMLETSo I do still, by these pickers and stealers.ROSENCRANTZGood my lord, what is your cause of distemper? youdo, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, ifyou deny your griefs to your friend.HAMLETSir, I lack advancement.ROSENCRANTZHow can that be, when you have the voice of the kinghimself for your succession in Denmark?HAMLETAy, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverbis something musty.Re-enter Players with recordersO, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw withyou:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,as if you would drive me into a toil?GUILDENSTERNO, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is toounmannerly.HAMLETI do not well understand that. Will you play uponthis pipe?GUILDENSTERNMy lord, I cannot.HAMLETI pray you.GUILDENSTERNBelieve me, I cannot.HAMLETI do beseech you.GUILDENSTERNI know no touch of it, my lord.HAMLET'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages withyour lingers and thumb, give it breath with yourmouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.Look you, these are the stops.GUILDENSTERNBut these cannot I command to any utterance ofharmony; I have not the skill.HAMLETWhy, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make ofme! You would play upon me; you would seem to knowmy stops; you would pluck out the heart of mymystery; you would sound me from my lowest note tothe top of my compass: and there is much music,excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannotyou make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I ameasier to be played on than a pipe? Call me whatinstrument you will, though you can fret me, yet youcannot play upon me.Enter POLONIUSGod bless you, sir!LORD POLONIUSMy lord, the queen would speak with you, andpresently.HAMLETDo you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?LORD POLONIUSBy the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.HAMLETMethinks it is like a weasel.LORD POLONIUSIt is backed like a weasel.HAMLETOr like a whale?LORD POLONIUSVery like a whale.HAMLETThen I will come to my mother by and by. They foolme to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.LORD POLONIUSI will say so.HAMLETBy and by is easily said.Exit POLONIUSLeave me, friends.Exeunt all but HAMLETTis now the very witching time of night,When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes outContagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,And do such bitter business as the dayWould quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.O heart, lose not thy nature; let not everThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:Let me be cruel, not unnatural:I will speak daggers to her, but use none;My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;How in my words soever she be shent,To give them seals never, my soul, consent!ExitSCENE III. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSI like him not, nor stands it safe with usTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;I your commission will forthwith dispatch,And he to England shall along with you:The terms of our estate may not endureHazard so dangerous as doth hourly growOut of his lunacies.GUILDENSTERNWe will ourselves provide:Most holy and religious fear it isTo keep those many many bodies safeThat live and feed upon your majesty.ROSENCRANTZThe single and peculiar life is bound,With all the strength and armour of the mind,To keep itself from noyance; but much moreThat spirit upon whose weal depend and restThe lives of many. The cease of majestyDies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth drawWhat's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser thingsAre mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,Each small annexment, petty consequence,Attends the boisterous ruin. Never aloneDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.KING CLAUDIUSArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;For we will fetters put upon this fear,Which now goes too free-footed.ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERNWe will haste us.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNEnter POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSMy lord, he's going to his mother's closet:Behind the arras I'll convey myself,To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:And, as you said, and wisely was it said,'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhearThe speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,And tell you what I know.KING CLAUDIUSThanks, dear my lord.Exit POLONIUSO, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,A brother's murder. Pray can I not,Though inclination be as sharp as will:My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;And, like a man to double business bound,I stand in pause where I shall first begin,And both neglect. What if this cursed handWere thicker than itself with brother's blood,Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavensTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercyBut to confront the visage of offence?And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,To be forestalled ere we come to fall,Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayerCan serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?That cannot be; since I am still possess'dOf those effects for which I did the murder,My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?In the corrupted currents of this worldOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice,And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itselfBuys out the law: but 'tis not so above;There is no shuffling, there the action liesIn his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,To give in evidence. What then? what rests?Try what repentance can: what can it not?Yet what can it when one can not repent?O wretched state! O bosom black as death!O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!All may be well.Retires and kneelsEnter HAMLETHAMLETNow might I do it pat, now he is praying;And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:A villain kills my father; and for that,I, his sole son, do this same villain sendTo heaven.O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.He took my father grossly, full of bread;With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?But in our circumstance and course of thought,'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,To take him in the purging of his soul,When he is fit and season'd for his passage?No!Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;At gaming, swearing, or about some actThat has no relish of salvation in't;Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,And that his soul may be as damn'd and blackAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.ExitKING CLAUDIUS[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:Words without thoughts never to heaven go.ExitSCENE IV. The Queen's closet.Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUSLORD POLONIUSHe will come straight. Look you lay home to him:Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,And that your grace hath screen'd and stood betweenMuch heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.Pray you, be round with him.HAMLET[Within] Mother, mother, mother!QUEEN GERTRUDEI'll warrant you,Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.POLONIUS hides behind the arrasEnter HAMLETHAMLETNow, mother, what's the matter?QUEEN GERTRUDEHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.HAMLETMother, you have my father much offended.QUEEN GERTRUDECome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.HAMLETGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhy, how now, Hamlet!HAMLETWhat's the matter now?QUEEN GERTRUDEHave you forgot me?HAMLETNo, by the rood, not so:You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.QUEEN GERTRUDENay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.HAMLETCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;You go not till I set you up a glassWhere you may see the inmost part of you.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?Help, help, ho!LORD POLONIUS[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!HAMLET[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!Makes a pass through the arrasLORD POLONIUS[Behind] O, I am slain!Falls and diesQUEEN GERTRUDEO me, what hast thou done?HAMLETNay, I know not:Is it the king?QUEEN GERTRUDEO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!HAMLETA bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,As kill a king, and marry with his brother.QUEEN GERTRUDEAs kill a king!HAMLETAy, lady, 'twas my word.Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUSThou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,If it be made of penetrable stuff,If damned custom have not brass'd it soThat it is proof and bulwark against sense.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongueIn noise so rude against me?HAMLETSuch an actThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the roseFrom the fair forehead of an innocent loveAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage-vowsAs false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deedAs from the body of contraction plucksThe very soul, and sweet religion makesA rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:Yea, this solidity and compound mass,With tristful visage, as against the doom,Is thought-sick at the act.QUEEN GERTRUDEAy me, what act,That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?HAMLETLook here, upon this picture, and on this,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.See, what a grace was seated on this brow;Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;A station like the herald MercuryNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;A combination and a form indeed,Where every god did seem to set his seal,To give the world assurance of a man:This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?You cannot call it love; for at your ageThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,And waits upon the judgment: and what judgmentWould step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,Else could you not have motion; but sure, that senseIs apoplex'd; for madness would not err,Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'dBut it reserved some quantity of choice,To serve in such a difference. What devil was'tThat thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,Or but a sickly part of one true senseCould not so mope.O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shameWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,Since frost itself as actively doth burnAnd reason panders will.QUEEN GERTRUDEO Hamlet, speak no more:Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;And there I see such black and grained spotsAs will not leave their tinct.HAMLETNay, but to liveIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making loveOver the nasty sty,--QUEEN GERTRUDEO, speak to me no more;These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;No more, sweet Hamlet!HAMLETA murderer and a villain;A slave that is not twentieth part the titheOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings;A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,And put it in his pocket!QUEEN GERTRUDENo more!HAMLETA king of shreds and patches,--Enter GhostSave me, and hover o'er me with your wings,You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?QUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, he's mad!HAMLETDo you not come your tardy son to chide,That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go byThe important acting of your dread command? O, say!GhostDo not forget: this visitationIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:O, step between her and her fighting soul:Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:Speak to her, Hamlet.HAMLETHow is it with you, lady?QUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, how is't with you,That you do bend your eye on vacancyAnd with the incorporal air do hold discourse?Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,Upon the heat and flame of thy distemperSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?HAMLETOn him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;Lest with this piteous action you convertMy stern effects: then what I have to doWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.QUEEN GERTRUDETo whom do you speak this?HAMLETDo you see nothing there?QUEEN GERTRUDENothing at all; yet all that is I see.HAMLETNor did you nothing hear?QUEEN GERTRUDENo, nothing but ourselves.HAMLETWhy, look you there! look, how it steals away!My father, in his habit as he lived!Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!Exit GhostQUEEN GERTRUDEThis the very coinage of your brain:This bodiless creation ecstasyIs very cunning in.HAMLETEcstasy!My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,And makes as healthful music: it is not madnessThat I have utter'd: bring me to the test,And I the matter will re-word; which madnessWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;And do not spread the compost on the weeds,To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;For in the fatness of these pursy timesVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.QUEEN GERTRUDEO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.HAMLETO, throw away the worser part of it,And live the purer with the other half.Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;Assume a virtue, if you have it not.That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,That to the use of actions fair and goodHe likewise gives a frock or livery,That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,And that shall lend a kind of easinessTo the next abstinence: the next more easy;For use almost can change the stamp of nature,And either [ ] the devil, or throw him outWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night:And when you are desirous to be bless'd,I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,Pointing to POLONIUSI do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,To punish me with this and this with me,That I must be their scourge and minister.I will bestow him, and will answer wellThe death I gave him. So, again, good night.I must be cruel, only to be kind:Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.One word more, good lady.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat shall I do?HAMLETNot this, by no means, that I bid you do:Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,Make you to ravel all this matter out,That I essentially am not in madness,But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?No, in despite of sense and secrecy,Unpeg the basket on the house's top.Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,To try conclusions, in the basket creep,And break your own neck down.QUEEN GERTRUDEBe thou assured, if words be made of breath,And breath of life, I have no life to breatheWhat thou hast said to me.HAMLETI must to England; you know that?QUEEN GERTRUDEAlack,I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.HAMLETThere's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;For 'tis the sport to have the engineerHoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hardBut I will delve one yard below their mines,And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,When in one line two crafts directly meet.This man shall set me packing:I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellorIs now most still, most secret and most grave,Who was in life a foolish prating knave.Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.Good night, mother.Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUSACT IVSCENE I. A room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSThere's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.Where is your son?QUEEN GERTRUDEBestow this place on us a little while.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNAh, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!KING CLAUDIUSWhat, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?QUEEN GERTRUDEMad as the sea and wind, when both contendWhich is the mightier: in his lawless fit,Behind the arras hearing something stir,Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'And, in this brainish apprehension, killsThe unseen good old man.KING CLAUDIUSO heavy deed!It had been so with us, had we been there:His liberty is full of threats to all;To you yourself, to us, to every one.Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?It will be laid to us, whose providenceShould have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,This mad young man: but so much was our love,We would not understand what was most fit;But, like the owner of a foul disease,To keep it from divulging, let it feedEven on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?QUEEN GERTRUDETo draw apart the body he hath kill'd:O'er whom his very madness, like some oreAmong a mineral of metals base,Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.KING CLAUDIUSO Gertrude, come away!The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,But we will ship him hence: and this vile deedWe must, with all our majesty and skill,Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNFriends both, go join you with some further aid:Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the bodyInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNCome, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;And let them know, both what we mean to do,And what's untimely done. O, come away!My soul is full of discord and dismay.ExeuntSCENE II. Another room in the castle.Enter HAMLETHAMLETSafely stowed.ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!HAMLETWhat noise? who calls on Hamlet?O, here they come.Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNROSENCRANTZWhat have you done, my lord, with the dead body?HAMLETCompounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.ROSENCRANTZTell us where 'tis, that we may take it thenceAnd bear it to the chapel.HAMLETDo not believe it.ROSENCRANTZBelieve what?HAMLETThat I can keep your counsel and not mine own.Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! whatreplication should be made by the son of a king?ROSENCRANTZTake you me for a sponge, my lord?HAMLETAy, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, hisrewards, his authorities. But such officers do theking best service in the end: he keeps them, likean ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, tobe last swallowed: when he needs what you havegleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, youshall be dry again.ROSENCRANTZI understand you not, my lord.HAMLETI am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in afoolish ear.ROSENCRANTZMy lord, you must tell us where the body is, and gowith us to the king.HAMLETThe body is with the king, but the king is not withthe body. The king is a thing--GUILDENSTERNA thing, my lord!HAMLETOf nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.ExeuntSCENE III. Another room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attendedKING CLAUDIUSI have sent to seek him, and to find the body.How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!Yet must not we put the strong law on him:He's loved of the distracted multitude,Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,This sudden sending him away must seemDeliberate pause: diseases desperate grownBy desperate appliance are relieved,Or not at all.Enter ROSENCRANTZHow now! what hath befall'n?ROSENCRANTZWhere the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,We cannot get from him.KING CLAUDIUSBut where is he?ROSENCRANTZWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.KING CLAUDIUSBring him before us.ROSENCRANTZHo, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERNKING CLAUDIUSNow, Hamlet, where's Polonius?HAMLETAt supper.KING CLAUDIUSAt supper! where?HAMLETNot where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certainconvocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Yourworm is your only emperor for diet: we fat allcreatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves formaggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is butvariable service, two dishes, but to one table:that's the end.KING CLAUDIUSAlas, alas!HAMLETA man may fish with the worm that hath eat of aking, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.KING CLAUDIUSWhat dost you mean by this?HAMLETNothing but to show you how a king may go aprogress through the guts of a beggar.KING CLAUDIUSWhere is Polonius?HAMLETIn heaven; send hither to see: if your messengerfind him not there, seek him i' the other placeyourself. But indeed, if you find him not withinthis month, you shall nose him as you go up thestairs into the lobby.KING CLAUDIUSGo seek him there.To some AttendantsHAMLETHe will stay till ye come.Exeunt AttendantsKING CLAUDIUSHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--Which we do tender, as we dearly grieveFor that which thou hast done,--must send thee henceWith fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;The bark is ready, and the wind at help,The associates tend, and every thing is bentFor England.HAMLETFor England!KING CLAUDIUSAy, Hamlet.HAMLETGood.KING CLAUDIUSSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.HAMLETI see a cherub that sees them. But, come; forEngland! Farewell, dear mother.KING CLAUDIUSThy loving father, Hamlet.HAMLETMy mother: father and mother is man and wife; manand wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!ExitKING CLAUDIUSFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:Away! for every thing is seal'd and doneThat else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERNAnd, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--As my great power thereof may give thee sense,Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and redAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awePays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly setOur sovereign process; which imports at full,By letters congruing to that effect,The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;For like the hectic in my blood he rages,And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.ExitSCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marchingPRINCE FORTINBRASGo, captain, from me greet the Danish king;Tell him that, by his licence, FortinbrasCraves the conveyance of a promised marchOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.If that his majesty would aught with us,We shall express our duty in his eye;And let him know so.CaptainI will do't, my lord.PRINCE FORTINBRASGo softly on.Exeunt FORTINBRAS and SoldiersEnter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and othersHAMLETGood sir, whose powers are these?CaptainThey are of Norway, sir.HAMLETHow purposed, sir, I pray you?CaptainAgainst some part of Poland.HAMLETWho commands them, sir?CaptainThe nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.HAMLETGoes it against the main of Poland, sir,Or for some frontier?CaptainTruly to speak, and with no addition,We go to gain a little patch of groundThat hath in it no profit but the name.To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;Nor will it yield to Norway or the PoleA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.HAMLETWhy, then the Polack never will defend it.CaptainYes, it is already garrison'd.HAMLETTwo thousand souls and twenty thousand ducatsWill not debate the question of this straw:This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,That inward breaks, and shows no cause withoutWhy the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.CaptainGod be wi' you, sir.ExitROSENCRANTZWilt please you go, my lord?HAMLETI'll be with you straight go a little before.Exeunt all except HAMLETHow all occasions do inform against me,And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,If his chief good and market of his timeBe but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,Looking before and after, gave us notThat capability and god-like reasonTo fust in us unused. Now, whether it beBestial oblivion, or some craven scrupleOf thinking too precisely on the event,A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdomAnd ever three parts coward, I do not knowWhy yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'Sith I have cause and will and strength and meansTo do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:Witness this army of such mass and chargeLed by a delicate and tender prince,Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'dMakes mouths at the invisible event,Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death and danger dare,Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be greatIs not to stir without great argument,But greatly to find quarrel in a strawWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,Excitements of my reason and my blood,And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I seeThe imminent death of twenty thousand men,That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plotWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,Which is not tomb enough and continentTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!ExitSCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a GentlemanQUEEN GERTRUDEI will not speak with her.GentlemanShe is importunate, indeed distract:Her mood will needs be pitied.QUEEN GERTRUDEWhat would she have?GentlemanShe speaks much of her father; says she hearsThere's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,Yet the unshaped use of it doth moveThe hearers to collection; they aim at it,And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;Which, as her winks, and nods, and gesturesyield them,Indeed would make one think there might be thought,Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.HORATIO'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strewDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.QUEEN GERTRUDELet her come in.Exit HORATIOTo my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:So full of artless jealousy is guilt,It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIAOPHELIAWhere is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?QUEEN GERTRUDEHow now, Ophelia!OPHELIA[Sings]How should I your true love knowFrom another one?By his cockle hat and staff,And his sandal shoon.QUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, sweet lady, what imports this song?OPHELIASay you? nay, pray you, mark.SingsHe is dead and gone, lady,He is dead and gone;At his head a grass-green turf,At his heels a stone.QUEEN GERTRUDENay, but, Ophelia,--OPHELIAPray you, mark.SingsWhite his shroud as the mountain snow,--Enter KING CLAUDIUSQUEEN GERTRUDEAlas, look here, my lord.OPHELIA[Sings]Larded with sweet flowersWhich bewept to the grave did goWith true-love showers.KING CLAUDIUSHow do you, pretty lady?OPHELIAWell, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker'sdaughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know notwhat we may be. God be at your table!KING CLAUDIUSConceit upon her father.OPHELIAPray you, let's have no words of this; but when theyask you what it means, say you this:SingsTo-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,All in the morning betime,And I a maid at your window,To be your Valentine.Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,And dupp'd the chamber-door;Let in the maid, that out a maidNever departed more.KING CLAUDIUSPretty Ophelia!OPHELIAIndeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:SingsBy Gis and by Saint Charity,Alack, and fie for shame!Young men will do't, if they come to't;By cock, they are to blame.Quoth she, before you tumbled me,You promised me to wed.So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,An thou hadst not come to my bed.KING CLAUDIUSHow long hath she been thus?OPHELIAI hope all will be well. We must be patient: but Icannot choose but weep, to think they should lay himi' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, mycoach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;good night, good night.ExitKING CLAUDIUSFollow her close; give her good watch,I pray you.Exit HORATIOO, this is the poison of deep grief; it springsAll from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,When sorrows come, they come not single spiesBut in battalions. First, her father slain:Next, your son gone; and he most violent authorOf his own just remove: the people muddied,Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor OpheliaDivided from herself and her fair judgment,Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:Last, and as much containing as all these,Her brother is in secret come from France;Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,And wants not buzzers to infect his earWith pestilent speeches of his father's death;Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,Will nothing stick our person to arraignIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,Like to a murdering-piece, in many placesGives me superfluous death.A noise withinQUEEN GERTRUDEAlack, what noise is this?KING CLAUDIUSWhere are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.Enter another GentlemanWhat is the matter?GentlemanSave yourself, my lord:The ocean, overpeering of his list,Eats not the flats with more impetuous hasteThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;And, as the world were now but to begin,Antiquity forgot, custom not known,The ratifiers and props of every word,They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'QUEEN GERTRUDEHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry!O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!KING CLAUDIUSThe doors are broke.Noise withinEnter LAERTES, armed; Danes followingLAERTESWhere is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.DanesNo, let's come in.LAERTESI pray you, give me leave.DanesWe will, we will.They retire without the doorLAERTESI thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,Give me my father!QUEEN GERTRUDECalmly, good Laertes.LAERTESThat drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlotEven here, between the chaste unsmirched browOf my true mother.KING CLAUDIUSWhat is the cause, Laertes,That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:There's such divinity doth hedge a king,That treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.Speak, man.LAERTESWhere is my father?KING CLAUDIUSDead.QUEEN GERTRUDEBut not by him.KING CLAUDIUSLet him demand his fill.LAERTESHow came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!I dare damnation. To this point I stand,That both the worlds I give to negligence,Let come what comes; only I'll be revengedMost thoroughly for my father.KING CLAUDIUSWho shall stay you?LAERTESMy will, not all the world:And for my means, I'll husband them so well,They shall go far with little.KING CLAUDIUSGood Laertes,If you desire to know the certaintyOf your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,Winner and loser?LAERTESNone but his enemies.KING CLAUDIUSWill you know them then?LAERTESTo his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;And like the kind life-rendering pelican,Repast them with my blood.KING CLAUDIUSWhy, now you speakLike a good child and a true gentleman.That I am guiltless of your father's death,And am most sensible in grief for it,It shall as level to your judgment pierceAs day does to your eye.Danes[Within] Let her come in.LAERTESHow now! what noise is that?Re-enter OPHELIAO heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's witsShould be as moral as an old man's life?Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,It sends some precious instance of itselfAfter the thing it loves.OPHELIA[Sings]They bore him barefaced on the bier;Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--Fare you well, my dove!LAERTESHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,It could not move thus.OPHELIA[Sings]You must sing a-down a-down,An you call him a-down-a.O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the falsesteward, that stole his master's daughter.LAERTESThis nothing's more than matter.OPHELIAThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.LAERTESA document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.OPHELIAThere's fennel for you, and columbines: there's ruefor you; and here's some for me: we may call itherb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue witha difference. There's a daisy: I would give yousome violets, but they withered all when my fatherdied: they say he made a good end,--SingsFor bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.LAERTESThought and affliction, passion, hell itself,She turns to favour and to prettiness.OPHELIA[Sings]And will he not come again?And will he not come again?No, no, he is dead:Go to thy death-bed:He never will come again.His beard was as white as snow,All flaxen was his poll:He is gone, he is gone,And we cast away moan:God ha' mercy on his soul!And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.ExitLAERTESDo you see this, O God?KING CLAUDIUSLaertes, I must commune with your grief,Or you deny me right. Go but apart,Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:If by direct or by collateral handThey find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,To you in satisfaction; but if not,Be you content to lend your patience to us,And we shall jointly labour with your soulTo give it due content.LAERTESLet this be so;His means of death, his obscure funeral--No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,No noble rite nor formal ostentation--Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,That I must call't in question.KING CLAUDIUSSo you shall;And where the offence is let the great axe fall.I pray you, go with me.ExeuntSCENE VI. Another room in the castle.Enter HORATIO and a ServantHORATIOWhat are they that would speak with me?ServantSailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.HORATIOLet them come in.Exit ServantI do not know from what part of the worldI should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.Enter SailorsFirst SailorGod bless you, sir.HORATIOLet him bless thee too.First SailorHe shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter foryou, sir; it comes from the ambassador that wasbound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I amlet to know it is.HORATIO[Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlookedthis, give these fellows some means to the king:they have letters for him. Ere we were two days oldat sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave uschase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put ona compelled valour, and in the grapple I boardedthem: on the instant they got clear of our ship; soI alone became their prisoner. They have dealt withme like thieves of mercy: but they knew what theydid; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the kinghave the letters I have sent; and repair thou to mewith as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. Ihave words to speak in thine ear will make theedumb; yet are they much too light for the bore ofthe matter. These good fellows will bring theewhere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold theircourse for England: of them I have much to tellthee. Farewell.'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'Come, I will make you way for these your letters;And do't the speedier, that you may direct meTo him from whom you brought them.ExeuntSCENE VII. Another room in the castle.Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTESKING CLAUDIUSNow must your conscience my acquaintance seal,And you must put me in your heart for friend,Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,That he which hath your noble father slainPursued my life.LAERTESIt well appears: but tell meWhy you proceeded not against these feats,So crimeful and so capital in nature,As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,You mainly were stirr'd up.KING CLAUDIUSO, for two special reasons;Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,But yet to me they are strong. The queen his motherLives almost by his looks; and for myself--My virtue or my plague, be it either which--She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,I could not but by her. The other motive,Why to a public count I might not go,Is the great love the general gender bear him;Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,Would have reverted to my bow again,And not where I had aim'd them.LAERTESAnd so have I a noble father lost;A sister driven into desperate terms,Whose worth, if praises may go back again,Stood challenger on mount of all the ageFor her perfections: but my revenge will come.KING CLAUDIUSBreak not your sleeps for that: you must not thinkThat we are made of stuff so flat and dullThat we can let our beard be shook with dangerAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:I loved your father, and we love ourself;And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--Enter a MessengerHow now! what news?MessengerLetters, my lord, from Hamlet:This to your majesty; this to the queen.KING CLAUDIUSFrom Hamlet! who brought them?MessengerSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:They were given me by Claudio; he received themOf him that brought them.KING CLAUDIUSLaertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.Exit MessengerReads'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked onyour kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to seeyour kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking yourpardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my suddenand more strange return. 'HAMLET.'What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?LAERTESKnow you the hand?KING CLAUDIUS'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'Can you advise me?LAERTESI'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;It warms the very sickness in my heart,That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,'Thus didest thou.'KING CLAUDIUSIf it be so, Laertes--As how should it be so? how otherwise?--Will you be ruled by me?LAERTESAy, my lord;So you will not o'errule me to a peace.KING CLAUDIUSTo thine own peace. If he be now return'd,As checking at his voyage, and that he meansNo more to undertake it, I will work himTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,Under the which he shall not choose but fall:And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,But even his mother shall uncharge the practiseAnd call it accident.LAERTESMy lord, I will be ruled;The rather, if you could devise it soThat I might be the organ.KING CLAUDIUSIt falls right.You have been talk'd of since your travel much,And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a qualityWherein, they say, you shine: your sum of partsDid not together pluck such envy from himAs did that one, and that, in my regard,Of the unworthiest siege.LAERTESWhat part is that, my lord?KING CLAUDIUSA very riband in the cap of youth,Yet needful too; for youth no less becomesThe light and careless livery that it wearsThan settled age his sables and his weeds,Importing health and graveness. Two months since,Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--I've seen myself, and served against, the French,And they can well on horseback: but this gallantHad witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,As he had been incorpsed and demi-naturedWith the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,Come short of what he did.LAERTESA Norman was't?KING CLAUDIUSA Norman.LAERTESUpon my life, Lamond.KING CLAUDIUSThe very same.LAERTESI know him well: he is the brooch indeedAnd gem of all the nation.KING CLAUDIUSHe made confession of you,And gave you such a masterly reportFor art and exercise in your defenceAnd for your rapier most especially,That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,If you opposed them. Sir, this report of hisDid Hamlet so envenom with his envyThat he could nothing do but wish and begYour sudden coming o'er, to play with him.Now, out of this,--LAERTESWhat out of this, my lord?KING CLAUDIUSLaertes, was your father dear to you?Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,A face without a heart?LAERTESWhy ask you this?KING CLAUDIUSNot that I think you did not love your father;But that I know love is begun by time;And that I see, in passages of proof,Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.There lives within the very flame of loveA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;And nothing is at a like goodness still;For goodness, growing to a plurisy,Dies in his own too much: that we would doWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changesAnd hath abatements and delays as manyAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,To show yourself your father's son in deedMore than in words?LAERTESTo cut his throat i' the church.KING CLAUDIUSNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:We'll put on those shall praise your excellenceAnd set a double varnish on the fameThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine togetherAnd wager on your heads: he, being remiss,Most generous and free from all contriving,Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,Or with a little shuffling, you may chooseA sword unbated, and in a pass of practiseRequite him for your father.LAERTESI will do't:And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.I bought an unction of a mountebank,So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,Collected from all simples that have virtueUnder the moon, can save the thing from deathThat is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my pointWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,It may be death.KING CLAUDIUSLet's further think of this;Weigh what convenience both of time and meansMay fit us to our shape: if this should fail,And that our drift look through our bad performance,'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this projectShould have a back or second, that might hold,If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.When in your motion you are hot and dry--As make your bouts more violent to that end--And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared himA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,Our purpose may hold there.Enter QUEEN GERTRUDEHow now, sweet queen!QUEEN GERTRUDEOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.LAERTESDrown'd! O, where?QUEEN GERTRUDEThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;There with fantastic garlands did she comeOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purplesThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weedsClambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;When down her weedy trophies and herselfFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;As one incapable of her own distress,Or like a creature native and induedUnto that element: but long it could not beTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious layTo muddy death.LAERTESAlas, then, she is drown'd?QUEEN GERTRUDEDrown'd, drown'd.LAERTESToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,And therefore I forbid my tears: but yetIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,But that this folly douts it.ExitKING CLAUDIUSLet's follow, Gertrude:How much I had to do to calm his rage!Now fear I this will give it start again;Therefore let's follow.ExeuntACT VSCENE I. A churchyard.Enter two Clowns, with spades, & cFirst ClownIs she to be buried in Christian burial thatwilfully seeks her own salvation?Second ClownI tell thee she is: and therefore make her gravestraight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds itChristian burial.First ClownHow can that be, unless she drowned herself in herown defence?Second ClownWhy, 'tis found so.First ClownIt must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. Forhere lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: itis, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drownedherself wittingly.Second ClownNay, but hear you, goodman delver,--First ClownGive me leave. Here lies the water; good: herestands the man; good; if the man go to this water,and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, hegoes,--mark you that; but if the water come to himand drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, hethat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.Second ClownBut is this law?First ClownAy, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.Second ClownWill you ha' the truth on't? If this had not beena gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'Christian burial.First ClownWhy, there thou say'st: and the more pity thatgreat folk should have countenance in this world todrown or hang themselves, more than their evenChristian. Come, my spade. There is no ancientgentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:they hold up Adam's profession.Second ClownWas he a gentleman?First ClownHe was the first that ever bore arms.Second ClownWhy, he had none.First ClownWhat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand theScripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'could he dig without arms? I'll put anotherquestion to thee: if thou answerest me not to thepurpose, confess thyself--Second ClownGo to.First ClownWhat is he that builds stronger than either themason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?Second ClownThe gallows-maker; for that frame outlives athousand tenants.First ClownI like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallowsdoes well; but how does it well? it does well tothose that do in: now thou dost ill to say thegallows is built stronger than the church: argal,the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.Second Clown'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, ora carpenter?'First ClownAy, tell me that, and unyoke.Second ClownMarry, now I can tell.First ClownTo't.Second ClownMass, I cannot tell.Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distanceFirst ClownCudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dullass will not mend his pace with beating; and, whenyou are asked this question next, say 'agrave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last tilldoomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me astoup of liquor.Exit Second ClownHe digs and singsIn youth, when I did love, did love,Methought it was very sweet,To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,O, methought, there was nothing meet.HAMLETHas this fellow no feeling of his business, that hesings at grave-making?HORATIOCustom hath made it in him a property of easiness.HAMLET'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment haththe daintier sense.First Clown[Sings]But age, with his stealing steps,Hath claw'd me in his clutch,And hath shipped me intil the land,As if I had never been such.Throws up a skullHAMLETThat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it wereCain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! Itmight be the pate of a politician, which this assnow o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,might it not?HORATIOIt might, my lord.HAMLETOr of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This mightbe my lord such-a-one, that praised my lordsuch-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?HORATIOAy, my lord.HAMLETWhy, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, andknocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:here's fine revolution, an we had the trick tosee't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.First Clown[Sings]A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,For and a shrouding sheet:O, a pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet.Throws up another skullHAMLETThere's another: why may not that be the skull of alawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does hesuffer this rude knave now to knock him about thesconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him ofhis action of battery? Hum! This fellow might bein's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, andthe recovery of his recoveries, to have his finepate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch himno more of his purchases, and double ones too, thanthe length and breadth of a pair of indentures? Thevery conveyances of his lands will hardly lie inthis box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?HORATIONot a jot more, my lord.HAMLETIs not parchment made of sheepskins?HORATIOAy, my lord, and of calf-skins too.HAMLETThey are sheep and calves which seek out assurancein that. I will speak to this fellow. Whosegrave's this, sirrah?First ClownMine, sir.SingsO, a pit of clay for to be madeFor such a guest is meet.HAMLETI think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.First ClownYou lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is notyours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.HAMLET'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.First Clown'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me toyou.HAMLETWhat man dost thou dig it for?First ClownFor no man, sir.HAMLETWhat woman, then?First ClownFor none, neither.HAMLETWho is to be buried in't?First ClownOne that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.HAMLETHow absolute the knave is! we must speak by thecard, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,Horatio, these three years I have taken a note ofit; the age is grown so picked that the toe of thepeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, hegaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been agrave-maker?First ClownOf all the days i' the year, I came to't that daythat our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.HAMLETHow long is that since?First ClownCannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: itwas the very day that young Hamlet was born; he thatis mad, and sent into England.HAMLETAy, marry, why was he sent into England?First ClownWhy, because he was mad: he shall recover his witsthere; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.HAMLETWhy?First Clown'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the menare as mad as he.HAMLETHow came he mad?First ClownVery strangely, they say.HAMLETHow strangely?First ClownFaith, e'en with losing his wits.HAMLETUpon what ground?First ClownWhy, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, manand boy, thirty years.HAMLETHow long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?First ClownI' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as wehave many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarcehold the laying in--he will last you some eight yearor nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.HAMLETWhy he more than another?First ClownWhy, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, thathe will keep out water a great while; and your wateris a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earththree and twenty years.HAMLETWhose was it?First ClownA whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?HAMLETNay, I know not.First ClownA pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured aflagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.HAMLETThis?First ClownE'en that.HAMLETLet me see.Takes the skullAlas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellowof infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hathborne me on his back a thousand times; and now, howabhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims atit. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I knownot how oft. Where be your gibes now? yourgambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not onenow, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, lether paint an inch thick, to this favour she mustcome; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tellme one thing.HORATIOWhat's that, my lord?HAMLETDost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'the earth?HORATIOE'en so.HAMLETAnd smelt so? pah!Puts down the skullHORATIOE'en so, my lord.HAMLETTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why maynot imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,till he find it stopping a bung-hole?HORATIO'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.HAMLETNo, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither withmodesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: asthus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; ofearth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto hewas converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & cThe queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?And with such maimed rites? This doth betokenThe corse they follow did with desperate handFordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.Couch we awhile, and mark.Retiring with HORATIOLAERTESWhat ceremony else?HAMLETThat is Laertes,A very noble youth: mark.LAERTESWhat ceremony else?First PriestHer obsequies have been as far enlargedAs we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;And, but that great command o'ersways the order,She should in ground unsanctified have lodgedTill the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,Her maiden strewments and the bringing homeOf bell and burial.LAERTESMust there no more be done?First PriestNo more be done:We should profane the service of the deadTo sing a requiem and such rest to herAs to peace-parted souls.LAERTESLay her i' the earth:And from her fair and unpolluted fleshMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,A ministering angel shall my sister be,When thou liest howling.HAMLETWhat, the fair Ophelia!QUEEN GERTRUDESweets to the sweet: farewell!Scattering flowersI hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,And not have strew'd thy grave.LAERTESO, treble woeFall ten times treble on that cursed head,Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious senseDeprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:Leaps into the graveNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,Till of this flat a mountain you have made,To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish headOf blue Olympus.HAMLET[Advancing] What is he whose griefBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrowConjures the wandering stars, and makes them standLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,Hamlet the Dane.Leaps into the graveLAERTESThe devil take thy soul!Grappling with himHAMLETThou pray'st not well.I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;For, though I am not splenitive and rash,Yet have I something in me dangerous,Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.KING CLAUDIUSPluck them asunder.QUEEN GERTRUDEHamlet, Hamlet!AllGentlemen,--HORATIOGood my lord, be quiet.The Attendants part them, and they come out of the graveHAMLETWhy I will fight with him upon this themeUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.QUEEN GERTRUDEO my son, what theme?HAMLETI loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothersCould not, with all their quantity of love,Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?KING CLAUDIUSO, he is mad, Laertes.QUEEN GERTRUDEFor love of God, forbear him.HAMLET'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?To outface me with leaping in her grave?Be buried quick with her, and so will I:And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throwMillions of acres on us, till our ground,Singeing his pate against the burning zone,Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,I'll rant as well as thou.QUEEN GERTRUDEThis is mere madness:And thus awhile the fit will work on him;Anon, as patient as the female dove,When that her golden couplets are disclosed,His silence will sit drooping.HAMLETHear you, sir;What is the reason that you use me thus?I loved you ever: but it is no matter;Let Hercules himself do what he may,The cat will mew and dog will have his day.ExitKING CLAUDIUSI pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.Exit HORATIOTo LAERTESStrengthen your patience in our last night's speech;We'll put the matter to the present push.Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.This grave shall have a living monument:An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;Till then, in patience our proceeding be.ExeuntSCENE II. A hall in the castle.Enter HAMLET and HORATIOHAMLETSo much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;You do remember all the circumstance?HORATIORemember it, my lord?HAMLETSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,That would not let me sleep: methought I layWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,And praised be rashness for it, let us know,Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach usThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will,--HORATIOThat is most certain.HAMLETUp from my cabin,My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the darkGroped I to find out them; had my desire.Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrewTo mine own room again; making so bold,My fears forgetting manners, to unsealTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--O royal knavery!--an exact command,Larded with many several sorts of reasonsImporting Denmark's health and England's too,With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,My head should be struck off.HORATIOIs't possible?HAMLETHere's the commission: read it at more leisure.But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?HORATIOI beseech you.HAMLETBeing thus be-netted round with villanies,--Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,They had begun the play--I sat me down,Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:I once did hold it, as our statists do,A baseness to write fair and labour'd muchHow to forget that learning, but, sir, nowIt did me yeoman's service: wilt thou knowThe effect of what I wrote?HORATIOAy, good my lord.HAMLETAn earnest conjuration from the king,As England was his faithful tributary,As love between them like the palm might flourish,As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wearAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities,And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,That, on the view and knowing of these contents,Without debatement further, more or less,He should the bearers put to sudden death,Not shriving-time allow'd.HORATIOHow was this seal'd?HAMLETWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.I had my father's signet in my purse,Which was the model of that Danish seal;Folded the writ up in form of the other,Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,The changeling never known. Now, the next dayWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequentThou know'st already.HORATIOSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.HAMLETWhy, man, they did make love to this employment;They are not near my conscience; their defeatDoes by their own insinuation grow:'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comesBetween the pass and fell incensed pointsOf mighty opposites.HORATIOWhy, what a king is this!HAMLETDoes it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,Thrown out his angle for my proper life,And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,To let this canker of our nature comeIn further evil?HORATIOIt must be shortly known to him from EnglandWhat is the issue of the business there.HAMLETIt will be short: the interim is mine;And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'But I am very sorry, good Horatio,That to Laertes I forgot myself;For, by the image of my cause, I seeThe portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put meInto a towering passion.HORATIOPeace! who comes here?Enter OSRICOSRICYour lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.HAMLETI humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?HORATIONo, my good lord.HAMLETThy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice toknow him. He hath much land, and fertile: let abeast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand atthe king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,spacious in the possession of dirt.OSRICSweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, Ishould impart a thing to you from his majesty.HAMLETI will receive it, sir, with all diligence ofspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.OSRICI thank your lordship, it is very hot.HAMLETNo, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind isnortherly.OSRICIt is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.HAMLETBut yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for mycomplexion.OSRICExceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, hismajesty bade me signify to you that he has laid agreat wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--HAMLETI beseech you, remember--HAMLET moves him to put on his hatOSRICNay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believeme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellentdifferences, of very soft society and great showing:indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card orcalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him thecontinent of what part a gentleman would see.HAMLETSir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;though, I know, to divide him inventorially woulddizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yawneither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in theverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul ofgreat article; and his infusion of such dearth andrareness, as, to make true diction of him, hissemblable is his mirror; and who else would tracehim, his umbrage, nothing more.OSRICYour lordship speaks most infallibly of him.HAMLETThe concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentlemanin our more rawer breath?OSRICSir?HORATIOIs't not possible to understand in another tongue?You will do't, sir, really.HAMLETWhat imports the nomination of this gentleman?OSRICOf Laertes?HORATIOHis purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.HAMLETOf him, sir.OSRICI know you are not ignorant--HAMLETI would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,it would not much approve me. Well, sir?OSRICYou are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--HAMLETI dare not confess that, lest I should compare withhim in excellence; but, to know a man well, were toknow himself.OSRICI mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputationlaid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.HAMLETWhat's his weapon?OSRICRapier and dagger.HAMLETThat's two of his weapons: but, well.OSRICThe king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbaryhorses: against the which he has imponed, as I takeit, six French rapiers and poniards, with theirassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of thecarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, veryresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,and of very liberal conceit.HAMLETWhat call you the carriages?HORATIOI knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.OSRICThe carriages, sir, are the hangers.HAMLETThe phrase would be more german to the matter, if wecould carry cannon by our sides: I would it mightbe hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horsesagainst six French swords, their assigns, and threeliberal-conceited carriages; that's the French betagainst the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?OSRICThe king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passesbetween yourself and him, he shall not exceed youthree hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and itwould come to immediate trial, if your lordshipwould vouchsafe the answer.HAMLETHow if I answer 'no'?OSRICI mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.HAMLETSir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please hismajesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; letthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and theking hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.OSRICShall I re-deliver you e'en so?HAMLETTo this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.OSRICI commend my duty to your lordship.HAMLETYours, yours.Exit OSRICHe does well to commend it himself; there are notongues else for's turn.HORATIOThis lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.HAMLETHe did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that Iknow the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune ofthe time and outward habit of encounter; a kind ofyesty collection, which carries them through andthrough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and dobut blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.Enter a LordLordMy lord, his majesty commended him to you by youngOsric, who brings back to him that you attend him inthe hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold toplay with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.HAMLETI am constant to my purpose; they follow the king'spleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; nowor whensoever, provided I be so able as now.LordThe king and queen and all are coming down.HAMLETIn happy time.LordThe queen desires you to use some gentleentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.HAMLETShe well instructs me.Exit LordHORATIOYou will lose this wager, my lord.HAMLETI do not think so: since he went into France, Ihave been in continual practise: I shall win at theodds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's hereabout my heart: but it is no matter.HORATIONay, good my lord,--HAMLETIt is but foolery; but it is such a kind ofgain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.HORATIOIf your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I willforestall their repair hither, and say you are notfit.HAMLETNot a whit, we defy augury: there's a specialprovidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will benow; if it be not now, yet it will come: thereadiness is all: since no man has aught of what heleaves, what is't to leave betimes?Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & cKING CLAUDIUSCome, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET'sHAMLETGive me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.This presence knows,And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'dWith sore distraction. What I have done,That might your nature, honour and exceptionRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.Sir, in this audience,Let my disclaiming from a purposed evilFree me so far in your most generous thoughts,That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,And hurt my brother.LAERTESI am satisfied in nature,Whose motive, in this case, should stir me mostTo my revenge: but in my terms of honourI stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,Till by some elder masters, of known honour,I have a voice and precedent of peace,To keep my name ungored. But till that time,I do receive your offer'd love like love,And will not wrong it.HAMLETI embrace it freely;And will this brother's wager frankly play.Give us the foils. Come on.LAERTESCome, one for me.HAMLETI'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignoranceYour skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,Stick fiery off indeed.LAERTESYou mock me, sir.HAMLETNo, by this hand.KING CLAUDIUSGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,You know the wager?HAMLETVery well, my lordYour grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.KING CLAUDIUSI do not fear it; I have seen you both:But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.LAERTESThis is too heavy, let me see another.HAMLETThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?They prepare to playOSRICAy, my good lord.KING CLAUDIUSSet me the stoops of wine upon that table.If Hamlet give the first or second hit,Or quit in answer of the third exchange,Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;And in the cup an union shall he throw,Richer than that which four successive kingsIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,The trumpet to the cannoneer without,The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.HAMLETCome on, sir.LAERTESCome, my lord.They playHAMLETOne.LAERTESNo.HAMLETJudgment.OSRICA hit, a very palpable hit.LAERTESWell; again.KING CLAUDIUSStay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;Here's to thy health.Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off withinGive him the cup.HAMLETI'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.They playAnother hit; what say you?LAERTESA touch, a touch, I do confess.KING CLAUDIUSOur son shall win.QUEEN GERTRUDEHe's fat, and scant of breath.Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.HAMLETGood madam!KING CLAUDIUSGertrude, do not drink.QUEEN GERTRUDEI will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.KING CLAUDIUS[Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.HAMLETI dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.QUEEN GERTRUDECome, let me wipe thy face.LAERTESMy lord, I'll hit him now.KING CLAUDIUSI do not think't.LAERTES[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.HAMLETCome, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;I pray you, pass with your best violence;I am afeard you make a wanton of me.LAERTESSay you so? come on.They playOSRICNothing, neither way.LAERTESHave at you now!LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTESKING CLAUDIUSPart them; they are incensed.HAMLETNay, come, again.QUEEN GERTRUDE fallsOSRICLook to the queen there, ho!HORATIOThey bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?OSRICHow is't, Laertes?LAERTESWhy, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.HAMLETHow does the queen?KING CLAUDIUSShe swounds to see them bleed.QUEEN GERTRUDENo, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.DiesHAMLETO villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.LAERTESIt is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;No medicine in the world can do thee good;In thee there is not half an hour of life;The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practiseHath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.HAMLETThe point!--envenom'd too!Then, venom, to thy work.Stabs KING CLAUDIUSAllTreason! treason!KING CLAUDIUSO, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.HAMLETHere, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?Follow my mother.KING CLAUDIUS diesLAERTESHe is justly served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,Nor thine on me.DiesHAMLETHeaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!You that look pale and tremble at this chance,That are but mutes or audience to this act,Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;Thou livest; report me and my cause arightTo the unsatisfied.HORATIONever believe it:I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:Here's yet some liquor left.HAMLETAs thou'rt a man,Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.O good Horatio, what a wounded name,Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!If thou didst ever hold me in thy heartAbsent thee from felicity awhile,And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,To tell my story.March afar off, and shot withinWhat warlike noise is this?OSRICYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,To the ambassadors of England givesThis warlike volley.HAMLETO, I die, Horatio;The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:I cannot live to hear the news from England;But I do prophesy the election lightsOn Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence.DiesHORATIONow cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!Why does the drum come hither?March withinEnter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and othersPRINCE FORTINBRASWhere is this sight?HORATIOWhat is it ye would see?If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.PRINCE FORTINBRASThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,That thou so many princes at a shotSo bloodily hast struck?First AmbassadorThe sight is dismal;And our affairs from England come too late:The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:Where should we have our thanks?HORATIONot from his mouth,Had it the ability of life to thank you:He never gave commandment for their death.But since, so jump upon this bloody question,You from the Polack wars, and you from England,Are here arrived give order that these bodiesHigh on a stage be placed to the view;And let me speak to the yet unknowing worldHow these things came about: so shall you hearOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,And, in this upshot, purposes mistookFall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can ITruly deliver.PRINCE FORTINBRASLet us haste to hear it,And call the noblest to the audience.For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.HORATIOOf that I shall have also cause to speak,And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;But let this same be presently perform'd,Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischanceOn plots and errors, happen.PRINCE FORTINBRASLet four captainsBear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;For he was likely, had he been put on,To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,The soldiers' music and the rites of warSpeak loudly for him.Take up the bodies: such a sight as thisBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.Go, bid the soldiers shoot.A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
